I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today marks the start of Digital Citizenship week. This year in 2021, it is the week of October 18th, and to kick it off, I want to share with you a bit of a lecture that I gave to a college class last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An economics professor teaches this class. And so, a little bit, I went to talk about how WordPress is essentially a microcosm of global societies. That was mostly why I was invited to come and give the talk. But one of the students asked a really interesting question about economics, and especially the economics of WordPress. And so, I&#8217;m going to take some time to do my best to answer that question here as well. But first, we&#8217;re going to start with some big picture information about WordPress that I shared with the students, and then maybe you also don&#8217;t necessarily know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first place that we started was with the question of what WordPress is. Most of them had heard of it but didn&#8217;t necessarily have a good handle on what it is. And so this is the definition that I gave to them. This is a bit of each of the facets of WordPress that we kind of see right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, WordPress is, of course, a content management system, which means it&#8217;s a piece of software that uses a copyleft license, which means that it&#8217;s open source, and no one individual necessarily owns the rights to the code. If you get very specific, WordPress is, of course, a FOSS project or a free and open source software project. I know that there are discussions around when a piece of software is free, then what are you using to pay for that piece of software or to pay for your access to that software? And often, the answer is that you&#8217;re using your personally identifying information to pay for something commonly referred to as the data economy. If you&#8217;re not familiar with that, it&#8217;s a little bit of a three-pronged effort there. So you submit your data to get access to the software, or you can join the platform, depending on what it is that you&#8217;re working with. That platform or that software collects your data so that they can build a profile about what sorts of content engages you and so that they can share, essentially, audience cohorts like groups of people that kind of are talking about what you&#8217;re talking about, agree with what you agree about, and find interesting, the same sorts of things that you find interesting. And then those companies sell access to your attention. This is something that I refer to as the attention economy. I think there are a lot of startups at the moment that refers to the attention economy. The most iconic recent example was when the folks over at Netflix said that they weren&#8217;t competing against other streaming services; they were competing against sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that might ring true for quite a few of us at the moment. But anyway, to scoot us back one level, I had, as I said, WordPress is free software. But the difference with WordPress is that to get a copy of WordPress, you are not necessarily required to hand over any data. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone data to get a copy. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone money or data to open up a copy that you own or to build a website in it if you&#8217;re just doing it locally, but especially around that data side because WordPress is not collecting any data, we&#8217;re also not brokering access to anyone&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another answer to the question of &#8220;What is WordPress?&#8221; WordPress software and the project enable nearly half a trillion dollars of revenue in the global digital economy, as we learned from a recent study from one of the hosting companies inside the WordPress project&nbsp; &#8211; oh, Inside the WordPress ecosystem anyway. And WordPress also runs 42% of the web, with some of the biggest sites we know using WordPress. Such sites like the New York Times, Rolling Stone, many, many others, which you can see in the WordPress showcase as well. I don&#8217;t necessarily want to just like call out all the big groups that use it. But it&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;To recap what we just learned about WordPress and what WordPress is. It is software that one uses a copyleft license, meaning no single entity owns it. Two, it is available at no cost, meaning no money changes hands for you to own a copy. Three does not track you, which means that you don&#8217;t have to give WordPress any personally identifying information to get a copy. Four is an enabler of a massive digital economy massive portion of the digital economy even. That, you know, means their services, extensions, themes, plugins, all of that stuff. And five, it is software that supports 42% of the web. Practically every other site you visit uses the software. So that&#8217;s WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this massive free software, you might be thinking to yourself a couple of things. The first thing you might be thinking is, &#8220;Well, that sounds impossible.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re thinking, you may be thinking, &#8220;how is it possible that a software that is technically owned by no one and takes no money or data to obtain &#8211;&nbsp; how is it that a software like that can power 42% of the web.&#8221; This brings me, of course, to a topic that I specialize in, which is how WordPress is made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is, by now you know, built by a global community of contributors. And it&#8217;s partially contributors that are self-sponsored or giving of their own time freely, and partly sponsored volunteers, people who are paid by Five for the Future initiatives inside various companies. I have said many times, most recently at WordCamp US, that I have an ideal ratio of about two to one in that kind of volunteer or self-sponsored versus corporately sponsored set of voices. And also, as I said, at WordCamp US, we’re not necessarily getting to that ideal ratio right now because of the nature of the way the world is at the moment. However, this community functions almost like a tiny little digital society. There are ways to get your voice heard ways to take on leadership roles; there is a little bit of light governmental structure. And as with any society, any community like this, there&#8217;s a relationship inherent there. There&#8217;s almost a transactional element that takes place when you&#8217;re participating fully. Although I know that for the WordPress project, especially for open source in general, there is a reminder that we should always be contributing without the expectation of reciprocity. But even if you are contributing without the expectation of reciprocity, you still are engaging in an existing community, which means that you are fostering a relationship with the community or with the people who are also participating in the community with you. It&#8217;s just inescapable if you have people around and working together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two concepts really informed my work to future-proof the WordPress project. And the first one is digital citizenship, which is why this particular WordPress Briefing fits today. And the other is the Tragedy of the Commons, especially how we go about refreshing those commons. So digital citizenship, I talked about it a bit in the last WP Briefing. But it&#8217;s still true today that that&#8217;s important. And the thing that really matters to me as we are working through how to make sure that WordPress is moving forward together. But most discussions of citizenship are location-specific, which makes plenty of sense. However, with so many mobile devices and broader access to some level of internet, we have increasing opportunities to be connected because of interests or skill sets. And even the things that we aspire to or aspire to be with a community like WordPress, which has no home office or main location. Of course, it&#8217;s very important that all of the leaders in WordPress, all of the team reps in WordPress, are proactively engaging with the people in their teams and in their portions of the community instead of waiting for like happenstance running into people. We also use a bunch of social stuff to get people together: twitch screams, not twitch screams because it&#8217;s not that Halloweeny! Twitch streams, hallway hangouts, events that are both online and off. Everything that the Learn section of the community is doing with their discussion groups. There are so many ways that WordPress proactively engages with each other and engages with itself. And that work is all really important to keeping the community involved, which is key to any organization&#8217;s long-term success, and certainly is true for WordPress as long-term success. Because when your community or your organization or your society is engaged and invested in your collective success, then you are (get ready for a list) one, more likely to see obstacles early and be able to overcome them, two more likely to see upcoming trends and prepare for them, three more likely to see what is broken and be able to repair it before it is a major issue. And four, you are more likely to be a resilient and fruitful organization long after any single member has stopped participating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more connected to the community you are and the more active, the greater your influence and the ability to affect changes also become. And so, not only is it important for us to remain connected as a community just to make sure that everything is going well. But also, it&#8217;s one of the primary ways that people who are giving back can sort of have more of an opportunity in this particular ecosystem. In open source, anyone can gain influence by helping others by helping the software and by keeping the trains on the tracks. And so, one of the only lasting limits to long-term potential in an open source project is how good you are at seeing beyond yourself and seeing what good action can make beyond just your own benefits. I understand that there are also specific hurdles to contribution in your free time that I have dedicated a couple of different podcasts to, so I don&#8217;t want to neglect that reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found in my experience that one of the limiting factors that sometimes cannot be unlearned is not being able to see kind of a broader scope, a broader perspective than what you&#8217;re already bringing into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So being a good digital citizen, that&#8217;s a really important part of keeping any society together any organization together and moving forward. But especially is in the context of digital citizenship, is true for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that is really important to me is this concept of the Tragedy of the Commons, which is, of course, an economics term, open source has borrowed. We have talked about it in this podcast in the past. And today, I specifically am talking about how WordPress works to consistently be refreshing the commons. So the theory of the Tragedy of the Commons says that all societies can withstand a certain volume of free-riders. A certain number of people who reap the benefits of that community’s society without necessarily putting anything back into it. And that is no different in open source than in any other place where you would apply this concept. The particular catch for WordPress is of course, that it is free, freely available and has no specific copyright holder. And so in those circumstances, it is incredibly easy for a small group of people to maintain the software while the whole world uses it for free. And not only is it possible for a small group of people to maintain it, but if you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s also easy for a small group of unpaid people and unacknowledged people to maintain something forever. And at the volume that WordPress operates at, that&#8217;s a really risky choice. It doesn&#8217;t help to support those people; it puts the long-term stability of the software in jeopardy. And at the end of the day, it just does not help to replenish the commons to make sure that everybody keeps getting to have the benefits of this ecosystem in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many of you know, there is this program called Five for the Future. And that program is essentially modeled after a tithe. So the invitation to this program when it was first introduced in 2014 was that if you or your company or your community is made better or made possible by WordPress, you should give back to the WordPress project 5% of your resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an aspirational 5%, of course, and some groups give back their time while others give back with their money. But almost anyone who wants to give back has some skill that WordPress needs. That particular program has really grown in leaps and bounds since it was introduced. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many team members were considered Five for the Future contributors when it was first introduced in 2014; it was a little before my time. But at the moment, it&#8217;s about 150 people that I am routinely aware of or in contact with, which is still a small number considering how many people use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many corporations who have seen the most benefit, including, you know, the company that I work for (Automattic), and a lot of other hosting companies in the ecosystem, all do a really good job of refreshing the commons so that WordPress is still usable for businesses of all levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to leave us with one final big picture thought about open source. This is going to be a callback to one of my earliest episodes in this podcast. But I think that it&#8217;s always worth remembering. We&#8217;re going to talk about this really popular phrase in open source projects &#8220;free as in speech, not free as in beer.&#8221; And for WordPress, as you know, it&#8217;s a little bit of both. It&#8217;s literally free. But also, since it&#8217;s open source, it has a free as in speech component to it as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four freedoms of open source as laid out in the 90s. So 10 years into the open source movement, are basically that you have the freedom to run the program for any purpose, the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so that it can do your computing as you wish, the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help your neighbor and the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to learn and benefit from the changes that you put into the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember if I said this in my original podcast, but I&#8217;m going to say it today, free speech has a lot of responsibility, just like being a part of a community. Governments or communities, or in our case, this software is built by the people who show up. For WordPress at 42% of the web, every small choice we make can cause huge changes in how people experience the web today and tomorrow. And that, to my mind, is really no different than participating in any sort of civic infrastructure. The changes that are made today, or the errors that we prevent, set the tone and the circumstance and the potential to thrive for everyone who comes after us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>18:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us into our smallest of big things. I just have a couple of things for you all today. Firstly, at the time of this recording, this is prior to the Go/No-Go demo meeting for WordPress 5.9. So I have no idea what&#8217;s happened. But by the time this podcast has been released, we will have had the Go/No-Go meeting and also have shipped the post that summarizes what happened, what we hope to change in the next essentially sprint so that we can confidently move forward with a clear set of features for the 5.9 release. I will include a link to the notes below in the show notes. Kudos to everyone, props to everyone who participated in that meeting. And also props to all the people who have been helping us as we head into this final release of the year and all of you who are going to help us make it successfully to the end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing I already kind of alluded to at the top of the podcast, it is Digital Citizenship week; two or three years ago, the WordPress blog had a series about digital citizenship and what it means to be a good digital citizen, what it means to do that in the context of WordPress. I will drop a link to those posts in the show notes as well. They are very well written and very important, and fairly evergreen content.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I want to talk to you a little bit about the digital divide, where it is, maybe a bit of where it&#8217;s headed, and which parts of the WordPress open source project and CMS can help. This is a focused look, though, so I won&#8217;t touch on some of the hurdles that everyone is aware of when you get outside of in-person environments, things like parental modeling or supervision, education on the relevance of technology, etc. This is a follow-up to the conversation that I had at WordCamp US last week—and so doing a little bit of a deeper dive here. And we&#8217;re gonna start with what exactly is the digital divide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the digital divide is considered those who benefit from the digital age versus those who don&#8217;t; that feels like a really big concept. And the current discussion is primarily about access, or for years that has been about access anyway, especially physical access. So those who have computers versus those who do not have internet in their homes versus those who do not. But I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with that particular, really focused definition of the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the only problem we see is access, then the solution becomes to get cheap devices and internet to everyone, which certainly has led to more people being connected than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this proliferation of devices that are considered both smart and mobile (mobile in this context, meaning handheld or pocket-sized), the discussion over the last few years has been shifting. It’s been shifting into more of a discussion around the education around the relevance of internet access, discussions around the quality of access to the Internet, and also discussions around Wi-Fi and dial-up and the surprising cost of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from my perspective, there are a number of really dangerous assumptions that we make when we boil it all the way down to who has access and the quality of that kind of access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first dangerous assumption is that we run the risk of conflating being tech-savvy with being digitally literate, and they&#8217;re not really the same things. The second assumption that we run the risk of is assuming that access to cellular data equals access to the internet through any other means. And also assuming that cost is always the determining factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final fairly dangerous assumption that we&#8217;re making there is that we allow ourselves the ability to mark the digital divide is fixed in our minds. Once we get enough access to everyone, we&#8217;re just done. There is no more divide. But as a way of illustration, if you think about access, not in the context of technology, like high technology, digital technology, and in the context of like writing, you probably own a writing utensil, and you probably have access to paper of some sort, which is great. But just because you have like a pencil and a piece of paper doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you home right now &#8211; I guess most of you are listening at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you to your desk right now. And consider you prepared to write a best-selling novel, right? Because giving you physical tools no more makes you a novelist than handing me a computer when I was a teen made me digitally literate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s talk about what it takes to be digitally literate. I&#8217;ve lumped the following skills into three groups. It&#8217;s broadly defined as 21st-century skills, but the groups that I have them in is not a comprehensive list of those 21st-century skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first group that is a large component of digital literacy is critical thinking skills. So computational thinking and problem-solving. That particular one is not new, exactly. But the computational thinking part certainly is. Not all problems are solved with code, but the basis for thinking through things procedurally is increasingly important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one in that set is communication through multiple media, consuming communications or content through Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other format, but also creating the things that communicate—writing blogs, creating videos, both calls and standalone, and forums, things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third set in that group of critical thinking skills is around collaboration, which some people will say is more about communication. But I find that collaboration both online and in-person is a skill set all to its own. Communication only gets you so far when you&#8217;re learning to cook to collaborate with people that you don&#8217;t normally work with. And so, I have lumped that into critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big bucket for digital literacy is actually literally digital literacy. So I have three, three things in here as well. Evaluating information is obviously incredibly important in the environment that we&#8217;re in right now, for just information’s sake. But then things like understanding the differences between copyright versus copyleft licenses, understanding the difference between an .org ending URL and a .com ending URL, and evaluating the general veracity of sources that you&#8217;re finding on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that group is media use and creation, understanding the difference between folks who consume and folks who create the content we have, how to find information online, and the most sensible places to keep information online. And the third area of digital literacy that I find to be vitally important is the ethics of licenses both around use and access. So again, things like copyright vs. Copy, copyleft. And specifically for WordPress, that means understanding things like the Creative Commons licenses, GPL, MIT, but then also copyright is its own complicated question unto itself. But the other things that show up for us for WordPress that show up for us with technology are also things like open access versus proprietary information and sources. And things like plagiarism versus sampling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our third big bucket, which has become increasingly complex, but the third big bucket for digital literacy to my mind is actually considered something that I call life skills. So things like self-direction, knowing what you want to do next, and how to get it done. Time management is also in there, knowing how much time something will take and being able to make sure that you are getting things done over time, as opposed to trying to accomplish everything at the last second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of these life skills is cross-cultural and social communication. The internet is tricky, right? Because it&#8217;s simultaneously incredibly insular and increasingly global. Like you can if you wanted only ever read things that already confirm your existing biases. But the very nature of the internet, the very nature of the web, means that the world is much smaller. We have more ready access faster to everyone everywhere in the world than we used to have. This means, of course, that cultural awareness is an absolute must now more than ever. This is for what it&#8217;s worth the time of year when I give this talk. And that&#8217;s because of this last part of the life skills section, which is digital citizenship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital citizenship generally is the second week of October 2 or the third week of October. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite weeks because it is something that comes up all the time in our ecosystem. It comes up all the time and open source in general, but certainly for WordPress. So those are our three big buckets of digital literacy, a subset of 21st-century skills as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff, I know. And it&#8217;s also really hard to figure out how you can learn any of those skills, and from my experience, I really believe that WordPress as an open source project can help people learn those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, my mother told me that in order for me to become a better writer, I would have to read and in order to become a better communicator, it would probably help if I spent a little bit more time writing, and I have always felt that the same must be true for all the things that we learn, you find a positive example and study it to become better. Or, depending on what you&#8217;re learning and how you&#8217;re trying to learn it, you find a passive example of something that you want to be able to do better from an active standpoint and participate in that so that your active production of the other part is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few parts of the WordPress project and WordPress itself that can help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are first a few really specific teams; if you&#8217;re contributing to a team like Themes, or Plugins, or Core, the three areas of those digital literacy skills that you have an opportunity to learn there. For critical thinking, you&#8217;re going to run into problem-solving and computational thinking. You’re also going to run into distributed collaboration, which was really important as just a concept when I first wrote this talk. And now it is currently really important as a reality because we have a bunch of companies that are going to either remote work or partially distributed or fully distributed. And that&#8217;s the way that WordPress has worked for a pretty long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve always felt like it was important because it was important to WordPress, but it&#8217;s also becoming increasingly an important part of just how to exist in the world at the moment. For those three teams, the things that you can really tap into and practice for the life skill section are digital literacy, nope, digital citizenship, self-direction, and time management obviously comes up in any open source project because you are volunteering your time and it is up to you to kind of decide how much you can commit or not various other parts of time management and directing one&#8217;s own project. Now, but you also get the opportunity to test and practice your cross-cultural communication, social communication and learning what it means to collaborate across cultures in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the digital literacy side, you also get a little bit of that information evaluation and synthesis for what it&#8217;s worth. And then obviously get to learn more about the ethics of various types of licenses and how use and access relate to those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a team or two; these are not really teams or twos. These are things that you can do that are either solo activities or group activities. One is working or checking out the support forums, and the other is blogging. We’ll start with support forums.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re doing this as a group activity, there are a couple of extra things that that you can practice here. But suppose you&#8217;re doing it as a solo, just way to give back to the project sort of thing or way to learn some of these skills sort of thing. In that case, you can get almost all of these digital literacy skills woven into working in the support forums, depending on what&#8217;s happening in the moment and the questions people have brought up. But for critical thinking, obviously, you get some problem solving in there, not as much the computational thinking as the procedural thinking part. But you certainly also get to tap into communication with multiple types of media, collaboration in person and online, depending on whether you&#8217;re doing this as a solo effort or a group effort. And then, of course, research, which I didn&#8217;t really bring up in any of those groupings for digital literacy, is certainly a very important part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the digital literacy grouping of skills related to digital literacy, you get to work on evaluating information and, depending on how complicated an answer might be. You can also get that opportunity to practice synthesizing complex information and research, a digital literacy skill. And then, once people have responded to a topic you&#8217;ve answered, you also get to tap into that life skill section. You get to be you get the opportunity to practice digital citizenship related to synchronous or asynchronous conversation. You also get to see more about how cross-cultural communication and collaboration works and social communication across those various boundaries that naturally show up when we&#8217;re working across cultures that way. And as I mentioned previously, information synthesis, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one that I have mentioned can be like a solo effort or a group effort, depending on what you do. Blogging, for most people who use WordPress, is probably the most common application of how WordPress can help you do stuff. So I often see it as the most relevant and the most immediately accessible to anyone. But you know, you got to meet people where they are. So, I would strongly believe that this is our best way to help people learn these things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So blogging for the critical thinking sorts of things, you have an opportunity to practice communication across mediums. You will probably get an opportunity to practice your research skills, chances are, you&#8217;re going to get the opportunity to practice some problem solving, and honestly, like if you&#8217;re hosting your site, problem-solving is going to come up when using WordPress as soon as you add in plugins and themes, because you sometimes kind of have to figure out what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not, and what&#8217;s playing nicely with other things and what&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s possible that with blogging, you&#8217;re also going to have an opportunity to get to practice some distributed collaboration. But that&#8217;s probably going to depend on what you&#8217;re doing with your site as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Licenses and how they apply to the thing that you&#8217;re using feel a bit different when you are the one who&#8217;s creating. And so learning about how those things work and don&#8217;t work and how they can best suit what you&#8217;re trying to do. Blogging is absolutely an excellent opportunity to dig into that a bit and learn a bit more about that. As far as your life skills go,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that&#8217;s where you, again, get to practice some digital citizenship by figuring out who your audiences are and also when you have to communicate with them via the comments or any other way that you have built up a feedback mechanism there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-direction obviously will come into this, maybe time management if you are blogging on, I was gonna say on a paid basis, but that&#8217;s not really I don&#8217;t know, on a project basis, like some of us are students and have to write things based on deadlines. And so, you know, self-direction, potentially time management, always cross-cultural communication, social communication, research, all of these things show up in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I really believe in this concept of how blogging and bringing people into maintaining a website can teach you all of these skills. Because when I was younger, I was a bad communicator. And now, I am across the board known for my effective communication and my ability to work across cultures. And so the defining moment, which was like a four-year moment, and so not necessarily a moment, but the thing that really made all the difference was when my mom challenged me to write every single day. She had noted that I was not necessarily great at getting from one point to the next. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily great at building my arguments when I had to explain something to people. And she suggested that writing every day would help me tap into this big thing about communication and working with other people collaboration, all of that. And as an adult on the other side of it. Like, I thought she was super wrong when I was younger, because don&#8217;t we all think our parents are wrong when we&#8217;re younger. But as an adult on the other side of it, not only was that an opportunity for me to literally learn how to communicate better. But it also, when I look at it, gave me access to opportunities to practice all sorts of 21st-century skills and digital literacy skills in an environment that was relatively safe. And so, I am a big proponent of this particular one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another team that helps us tap into and practice a lot of our digital literacy skills is the Documentation team. I recommend that you let this be a supervised activity if you&#8217;re doing this with students because, you know, it&#8217;s a wiki. You can put weird things in there on accident or just inaccurate things. So for critical thinking, the primary skill that you&#8217;re going to be able to practice if you&#8217;re working on documentation is collaboration. You would think that it was also like information synthesis and information evaluation. But for a lot of the work that we&#8217;re doing, the documentation exists. And what we&#8217;re looking at is trying to figure out where it no longer matches what is currently in the CMS, or currently in the project or currently in the team, whatever it is that you&#8217;re working on at that moment. And so, it&#8217;s a strong collaborative effort in the WordPress project. You have to have done the general work to figure out what needs to be changed in the documentation. But a lot of times, you need to figure out who has access to make the changes, what has prevented us from making changes in the past, and things like that. And so I say, collaboration is the only one to learn and critical thinking, but it&#8217;s actually a really big one and can take a fair amount of effort in this particular context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>20:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the digital literacy aspect, of course, there is evaluating information. But this particular type of information evaluation is a little different for documentation. And this actually is true for the Documentation team, for the Training team, and also for the new Learn team. This question is true for all of them. There is a huge difference between presentation versus application of information. The way you present information for people who already know it and just need confirmation of something or are using it for reference material is really different from when people are looking at a piece of documentation that should be telling them how to accomplish something. And they try to apply it either to their own processes at the moment or apply it to teaching other people. And so evaluating information to make sure that what is presented can be applied, and all of the ways that that very complicated journey with managing information can kind of work or not, depending on how things are going in your section of the open source project at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>21:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third group of skills that you can really dig into in those teams, again, is digital citizenship, basically, everything is digital citizenship in WordPress because we&#8217;re just people online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this final grouping that we have this final team and group of skills. So the Community team is a substantial and far-ranging team; they have many things that fall into their area of expertise. And so this has traditionally kind of functioned as a linchpin around education and ensuring that that was all relevant for users and attendees of events. The Community team will remain pivotal to so many things that we do now. But now that we have really awakened the Learn team and re-enlivened that Training team, this will shift a little over time. But yes, so that grain of salt that depending on when you listen to this, if you listen to it in 2050, maybe it&#8217;s not accurate anymore. Hopefully, most of what I say is not accurate in 2050. But you know, still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Anyway! Critical thinking that&#8217;s where we were. So the critical thinking group of skills inside the Community team, you are going to have an opportunity to practice problem-solving. And frequently also procedural thinking, depending on what you&#8217;re working on in that team. Multimedia communication is absolutely true. And that&#8217;s true, whether you contribute to the team itself and make sure that the team is functioning and doing their basic tasks. Or if you are organizing an entire event, whether it&#8217;s online or offline or however that is being accomplished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multimedia communication for this particular team is constant for all of their work and something that everyone who works on there gets to practice all the time. For digital literacy, this comes up a lot if what you&#8217;re doing is working through any sort of like programming plans, making sure that what we have in place for events is really excellent. It&#8217;s a really excellent opportunity for practicing the evaluation of information, learning more about media use and creation, and then naturally, everything to do with licenses copyright copyleft, not only for everything that we produce but then also for everyone in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team helps so many plugins, authors and theme developers, and other groups who participate in the ecosystem understand the nuances of the GPL and why it matters so much to WordPress. And then in the life skill section, there&#8217;s the obvious life skill section, life skills that have come up for all of them—so digital citizenship, cross-cultural and social communication. But also you have the opportunity to tap into that self-direction and time management practice, which probably should also be considered in all of these teams. But, you know, things change as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the most likely digital literacy skills that you would end up practicing in the Community team, depending on how you are participating in the Community team at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said that we would talk a little bit about where this is all headed and what to do next. And like I just said, when I got lost in my own reverie, they&#8217;re like, hopefully, everything that I&#8217;ve shared here is out of date by 2050. Like, if we can come back to this particular podcast, or this presentation, or anything I&#8217;ve ever said, about digital literacy over my time with WordPress. And if we could come back to that in 2050, or, you know, I was going to say, 20 years from now, 2041 feels really close. But, you know, come back to it in the future, and say, that was all really excellent information to know at the moment. And we did do those things. And now, WordPress has proven that open source contribution and collaboration can teach all of the necessary 21st-century skills that anyone would need to survive in the world. And we did do it, that would be really cool. But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed. Not because I don&#8217;t think people believe in what I&#8217;m saying or care about what I&#8217;m saying. But because it&#8217;s very easy to kind of let these things go at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>27:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you at some point, were proficient in all of what is considered 21st-century skills, sometimes our skills don&#8217;t get used very much. And so we lose track of them. And we don&#8217;t know, or we don&#8217;t know how to teach them to other people and various ways to do that. So I hope that when we revisit this in the time capsule of the internet 20 years from now, we can say that was a great explanation. And we learned so much. And we made so many changes in such progress that now we need a new version of this. That&#8217;s really all we can do, always striving to leave the world in a better position than when we found it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>28:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, that brings us to our small list of big things. I don&#8217;t have a ton to share with you today. But what I do have to share with you is a really big deal. So we are about a week away from the Go/No-Go point of WordPress 5.9. That is the final release of the year. And as soon as we know what is a go or a no go from that meeting on October 12th,&nbsp; everyone is going just to hit the ground running. And so, if you are interested in contributing to that release, either by being a participant in the release squad or leading some part of the release squad. Absolutely. Drop by and let me know because I am interested to know who wants to learn more about doing that. And this is actually something that has gone by. I mentioned at the top that I spoke at WordCamp US.&nbsp; That is still true; I did do it. And so did a bunch of other really excellent presenters. If you missed WordCamp US on Friday, for whatever reason, because you know, life is complicated. Pretty soon, we will have the videos. We&#8217;ll have all the videos up with captions quickly and have those available for everyone to watch and learn more from as their schedule allows and as their attention allows. And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphos, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11316\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"People of WordPress: Yordan Soares\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/people-of-wordpress-yordan-soares/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:14:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11279\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:132:\"To coincide with International Translation Day, we feature the story of a developer and translator Yordan Soares from South America.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14138:\"\n<p><strong>WordPress is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To coincide with International Translation Day and the final day of the <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">2021 WordPress Translation celebration</a>, we feature the story of a WordPresser who has made a major impact in the polyglots team. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beyond software, meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/yordan-min-300x300@2x.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11299\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/yordan-min-300x300@2x.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/yordan-min-300x300@2x.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/yordan-min-300x300@2x.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Yordan Soares from South America, finding WordPress also meant discovering friends, community, and opportunities. He had not expected to find a whole global movement behind the web development software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan, who is from Venezuela, South America, said: “The first time I used WordPress, I had no idea what was going on behind the software or beyond it. I knew there was someone making it all work, but I couldn’t even remotely imagine all the people who were making WordPress not just a tool for developing websites, but a whole movement that comes together to share, build, and help make the world better.”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turning your hobby into your job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Yordan earned his income from computer technical support and installing networks for small and medium-sized businesses. Back in 2005, web development and code-writing was just a hobby. When he discovered the concept of CSS and how it could make everything dynamic. This opened up a whole new career pathway for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, an introduction to WordPress through a friend opened up a future he had not imagined. He stopped using any other content management system (CMS) and wanted to explore how much he could do with the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years later in 2013, he was able to take his WordPress journey further by starting a small advertising agency with some of his friends. During this time, they crafted commercials for local radio and TV stations. Through WordPress, they found it easy to build more than 15 websites for businesses in a market that previously had not valued the importance of having an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “We were working for almost four years until at the end of 2017 the economic crisis in Venezuela became too acute, and we decided to close the agency when we stopped making profits. Taking stock of that period, I think we changed the way merchants saw the Internet business in the city.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Working full time as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One year on in 2018, Yordan began to freelance full-time as a web developer. His first clients were primarily agencies and friends who had emigrated to other countries. Later, he expanded into freelance marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, getting started as a freelancer was quite a challenging task in Venezuela. The first hindrance was getting a fair level of recompense. Additionally, the deteriorating conditions in the country with constant blackouts and internet connection failures complicated matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Yordan was living in Guarenas, where the situation was relatively better. He managed to get a reasonably uninterrupted electricity supply with adequate internet speed, which was just good enough to complete his projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Surely if I hadn’t met the community, I would have continued to work on my own, like a lone wolf, doing the ordinary work of solving problems for occasional customers and paying my bills,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in Guarenas, Yordan began to experience stability in his career and made new friends and contacts. He began looking for co-working spaces or technology communities nearby, and that’s when he met the WordPress community in Caracas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He quickly signed up for the first face-to-face event. As soon as the event concluded, he went to talk to the co-organizer and offered his help. He was inspired to help with designing promotional pieces, managing social networks, and organizing events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through such events, he met and connected with several people living in nearby cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:32% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"120\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1-120x300.png?resize=120%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11300 size-medium\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1.png?resize=120%2C300&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1.png?w=240&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"> A few months later, with other WordPress users in the area, the idea emerged to start a new Guarenas-Guatire meetup group. The idea became a reality by December 2019, when they applied to the WordPress community team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final approvals came in, the team started scheduling the activities. The <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-meetup-guarenas-guatire/\">WordPress Guarenas-Guatire Meetup</a> was officially recognized!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first quarter of 2020, just before the pandemic, Yordan and colleagues organized five face-to-face events. With the worldwide lockdown, in-person community engagements came to a halt. However, the Guarenas-Guatire community was eager to continue meeting.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep the community active and motivated, and with the support of sponsors, they started organizing online events under a format called “WordPress a la medianoche” (WordPress at midnight).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of these events was inspired by Alexis Arnal, who suggested meeting at midnight to make the most of the internet speed that would usually improve somewhat after that time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Yordan and the team have organized 16 WordPress a la medianoche events with an attendance of up to 50 people per online gathering. An impressive audience which enabled a comparatively small meetup to keep communications flowing at a difficult and unprecedented time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One positive of such events, is an opportunity to invite people from other countries and run sessions in partnership with others. An example was a special translation event with Javier Esteban, a member of the translation team from Spain. The meetup also invited contributors from Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia who were happy to participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strengthened by the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=632%2C241&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11307\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=1536%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?w=1889&amp;ssl=1 1889w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Yordan (pictured bottom left) speaking at the WordPress Translation Day 2020 events</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan believes that he would have continued to work on his own had he not met the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Fortunately, this was not the case and I have been able to live a lot of transforming experiences that have shown me the meaning of the words &#8216;community&#8217; and &#8216;volunteerism&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan felt empowered by the community and it led him to volunteer for many other roles and activities, including Locale Manager for <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/es-ve/\">Spanish Venezuela</a>, a moderator for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>, and as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/\">support</a> contributor in the forums helping people with technical issues. He has also developed free plugins for the official WordPress directory and <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/speakers/yordan-soares/\">spoken at community events</a> including <a href=\"https://spain.wordcamp.org/2020/session/actualizaciones-automaticas-para-tus-plugins-y-temas-personalizados/\">WordCamp Spain 2020</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this has a boomerang effect, Yordan explains. These experiences helped him grow personally and professionally, as it’s always rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also likes being able to directly help people when they need it and feels it is a two-way learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At first, when I told my family and friends about the community and the work I was doing, they would ask me &#8216;what do you get in return?&#8217; Perhaps they expected me to tell them a specific amount of money, but the answer is more complex,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem, the tool you use to work and put food on the table.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his journey, Yordan has met many wonderful people with common interests and values, and the best part is that many of these people are now his friends, business partners, or customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, he has learned new skills and gained experience, which have given him a significant confidence boost in facing difficult situations that may come in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=632%2C332&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Polyglots special appreciation.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m going to take you through a quick look at the final WordPress release of 2021. It will be WordPress 5.9. And there will be a ton of things in it, including a fresh new default theme. And there are a few things that you need to know about it right now. The target release date is December 14, 2021, which means some of our milestones happen around Thanksgiving in the US. And a few significant commercial dates globally, days, like Giving Tuesday and Black Friday, etc. I&#8217;ll include a link to the post with all the target dates in the show notes so that you can plan with those in mind. And also in the show notes. I&#8217;ll include a link to Matías Ventura&#8217;s post that includes the target features for the release. When you look at that post, you&#8217;ll notice that you can sort of group things into two big buckets. The two buckets that I grouped them into are themes plus tools, and also better tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bucket number one themes and all their tools. Three things were important for me as I was reading through them. Number one is that there is a default theme. As of the time of this recording, I&#8217;ve seen the early concepts for the theme, and I love them. Hopefully, by the time this podcast is published, the post that showcases the look and feel will also be up on make.wordpress.org/design. If it is, I&#8217;ll include a link in the show notes to make it easy for everyone to reference.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is block themes in general. So WordPress 5.8 brought to core WordPress a lot of the infrastructure needed to create block themes. And in this release in WordPress 5.9, much of that infrastructure will be made available for folks who don&#8217;t always feel comfortable working in the code. That&#8217;s mostly UX and UI changes. So user experience and user interface changes are based on user feedback that we&#8217;ve gathered over the last six to eight months. But it also will include the long-awaited navigation block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that shows up for me in this first bucket, in the themes and all their tools bucket, is the UX and interface for theme.json. The user interface that we&#8217;re making available for theme.json is a major step forward in this project has been referred to as global styles for a few years. And it kind of is what it sounds like on the box, a way for users to tap into that powerful management tool that we have built through theme.JSON.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bucket number two, which I am calling publicly &#8220;tools for days.&#8221; But also, I refer to it as design tools, block tools, and pattern tools. I had this whole vision of a Wizard of Oz, “lions and tigers and bears. Oh my!” moment, but I couldn’t make it work. So “design tools and block tools and pattern tools Hoorah!” That&#8217;s as close as we&#8217;re getting. So that&#8217;s my first big number two bucket for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of these tools, the best way to describe it is quality of life improvements, lots of streamlining of what&#8217;s there, lots of building what&#8217;s not. But there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s substantial and worth digging into a bit more. And that&#8217;s the gallery block refactor. The dev note for this already exists. Like before we had the planning round-up post, the dev note was created. And so I will put a link to that in the show notes. But the headline is that this refactor will make the creation and maintenance of image blocks and the gallery block work the same way. If you are a theme or plugin developer, head on over to the dev notes that I have linked below and take some time to get familiar with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing, which has a bunch of small things in it, but will make a huge impact for all of our users overall, is that we&#8217;re working on more intuitive and responsive tools on blocks. That has come up frequently in our user testing again over the last six to eight months. And we are going to chip away at that long list of needs that we have in those particular toolsets. And that&#8217;s it. So that&#8217;s a really big broad look at what we&#8217;re trying to get into the final release of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp; know that when I say like this is our hoped for stuff. This is our best guess at the moment. Sometimes it can feel like we should know that already &#8212; I should know already what&#8217;s going into the release. And on the one hand, yes, I believe in this list of things that we&#8217;re going to put into the release, I think they&#8217;re going to be good. But I always refer to it as like the hoped-for things, the things that are on the roadmap, our best targets, because I know that I don&#8217;t ever want to ship something that is going to be a worse experience for users. And so I always like to save the space to be able to remove a feature or remove an enhancement, a little bit closer to the time of the release, just to make sure that what we are offering is the best that we can offer. However, as it says right there in the 19 learnings of open source, “if there&#8217;s a bug, there&#8217;s a job,” right? There&#8217;s a lot of tolerance in open source software for shipping, slightly imperfect work. And that&#8217;s good. When we ship software that&#8217;s a little bit imperfect, it makes it clear how everyone can participate, how everyone could participate, if they could find this WordPress community that supports the CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never participated in a release and are interested in learning how it goes, you can always follow along on make.wordpress.org/core. And of course, we do a lot of our meetings in the making WordPress, community Slack, which you can find at chat.wordpress.org if you are not already in that particular instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. I have three things on my list for you. The first one is WP Translation day slash month. For folks who&#8217;ve been following along for a bit, you probably noticed that Translation Day has been going on all month long all of September so that we can have small individual local events and bring people into the process of translating WordPress and making WordPress more usable for more people, especially when they don&#8217;t necessarily speak English as their first language. It&#8217;s a wonderful event. There&#8217;s been Translation Day at the end of September for years. And this Translation Month is working its way up to that Translation Day; I will leave a link to the event page in the notes below. And I really encourage you to drop by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordCamp US is coming up on October 1. It is going to be a virtual event, as so many of our events are right now. Tickets are open. The schedule just got published last week. And so we have a good concept of who is talking about what while we&#8217;re there. I suggest you wander over to the schedule. Take a look at anything that might be inspirational to you or anyone who looks like they&#8217;re answering questions that you&#8217;ve had as you have been trying to build your WordPress business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things. Some of you may already be aware that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/andreamiddleton/\">Andrea Middleton</a> has left the WordPress project. She has been an absolute fixture in the WordPress open source project for the last ten years. And while we will all miss her terribly, her work has been so influential and so foundational that we actually won&#8217;t really feel much like she&#8217;s gone. We will see the evidence of her work in everything she does and everything she has done while we build a better and more inclusive WordPress after her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a final love letter to the community, she published a series of things that she learned about contributing to open source and especially how to contribute to WordPress as an open source project. I&#8217;m going to link those in the show notes as well. For anyone who has worked with Andrea for a long time, when you read it, it will just remind you of her voice and will be like a nice warm, comforting hug as she heads on to her next endeavors. And for folks who have never worked with her before. It&#8217;s still really excellent information that I think translates into all areas of our work, especially right now as people are moving to distributed work and remote work a bit more.

Normally I talk to you about WordPress and stuff, but I figured that we all need a little levity in our lives right now. So today&#8217;s episode is actually just a series of bloopers and mistakes that I&#8217;ve made while recording. When I was preparing for this podcast, no one mentioned the deep weirdness of standing alone in your closet talking to yourself, nor did they realize just how lost I can get in the surpassingly, lovely lyricism of a lilting line, and then just have no idea what I&#8217;m supposed to be reading in the script that I wrote for myself. So, my dear friends, I hope these bring you a little laugh. And if we&#8217;ve got any luck at all, you may also hear me singing to myself, my computer, or about how terrible my talking just was. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to a bonus briefing. I know I wasn&#8217;t going to sit boop, boop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I messed up the thing where I&#8217;m talking about how I mess up, of course. I&#8217;m going to do it one more time, and you can choose whatever is a reasonable thing there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we had such a lengthy WP Briefing, WordPress, I’m going to just start that over again. Sorry, everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friends. Oh, no. I don&#8217;t know how I end my own show. How do I end my own show? There we go. Sorry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a weird way to say that. I&#8217;m going to start over again from the transition. And then we&#8217;re just going to go straight through to the end. Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The names that&#8230; I sound weird. I sound like I don&#8217;t know what my words are. And I said I wrote the words. I said I was all going to go in one go, and I&#8217;m a liar today. Okay, here we go. For realsies!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final first last take. Here we go. Sorry, I made myself laugh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg. And, and I, I&#8217;m also in that group. I don&#8217;t know why I said that like it was a surprise. I have me too. I&#8217;m also in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugh, I ran out of air. For reasons, it was a short sentence. I don&#8217;t know why I ran out of air.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming out on April 14. That&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s April 13. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the form below to share the. Pfft &#8211; what are the things!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is WP Briefing episode seven, no title because I don&#8217;t know what to call it because I gave it a title already. I gave it two titles, and then couldn&#8217;t remember why I gave it those titles. So I&#8217;ll come up with a title before we publish it. But I also have no idea what it is. I&#8217;m going to ask for help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing project since I have too many commas, and I really believed in my comma when I said it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Gutenberg&#8230; pfft. Open source software like WordPress. I was going to smash that sentence into half a sentence. I was going to say when you know what you&#8217;re workussing on you have a solution which is not my friends of thing. So, I am just going to say the sentence again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was sitting over here wringing my hands for some reason during that entire list. And so if you can hear me wringing my hands, which would be a whole new height of anxiety for anyone, you let me know, and I will rerecord that also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a concept of. Nope, this is a lie. Get a concept of where to get your tickets is the silliest thing. I&#8217;m starting over from the small list of big things. Also, because I got too excited about how big my list is. I am going to get that excited again. But I will try not to shout about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Humming intro song&#8221; Dun dun dun dun dun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, I had to scroll up, and I try not to scroll up when I&#8217;m talking in case maybe my whole computer turns into a microphone. Sorry, I&#8217;m just going to keep going because this has been a fine take so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercy! I have words that I can say with my mouth. They aren&#8217;t these words today. It seems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build up to&#8230; Oh my goodness. My stomach grumbled, and this microphone, I know,&nbsp; picked it up. And so I&#8217;m going to redo bullet two so that we don&#8217;t just have a small monster under the bed in the middle of the podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, like DEI, I feel s—Eh &#8211; maybe I should say, DEI, somewhere in there, so it&#8217;s clear for people cause I&#8217;m talking to people and not actually a screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I joined the WordPress project, the majority of my work with accessibility was in the context of the digital divide. Now, when talking about the digital divide, there are three concepts around quote-unquote, getting things to people. And those concepts are&#8230; I guess I could say the thing, hold on one second, I can do it. I feel like I&#8217;m chopping up my words like I&#8217;m not really breathing very well. So I apologize. But here we go again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t include that one. Sorry, I&#8217;m so nervous about this episode that, like, my mouth is getting dry, and I worry that you can hear it, and it drives me nuts every time I hear podcasters with a dry mouth, and you can just like hear it clicking and always stresses me out. I&#8217;m like, someone should give that poor thing a drink of water. And I just know I&#8217;m going to feel that way about myself later. And so I&#8217;m trying to stay hydrated, but it also means that I have to stop every two paragraphs and take a drink of water. I apologize for that interlude. I am about to start again, at my next section, which is like, halfway through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I learned that you can hear me swallowing my water with this microphone because it is a spectacular microphone. And so, I apologize for that as well. All right. Here I go. I&#8217;m going to do it all in one take. Watch me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have questions, especially about how to move everything forward. Mm-hmm. Whoops. I put especially in the wrong spot. But I also thought&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Ta da, we did it.

In this post, I’ll highlight a few cool things that are now possible to do with your widgets and where things may be heading next.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/site-long-1x.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"1130\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/site-long-1x.png?resize=632%2C1130&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A zoomed-out view of a single post with one sidebar widget area and two footer widget areas.

Here’s what I can create in the classic widgets editor (above) versus what I can create in the new block-based widget editor (below).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/classic-widgets.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/block-widgets-1.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Intersperse Widgets and Custom Code Throughout Your Visual Designs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Container blocks like Cover and Columns make it easy to weave dynamic or interactive elements into your designs. While this is a given for many widgets, the block versions of widgets can be easily wrapped and layered within container blocks to integrate them into your layout more fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example below, I tried placing a Search block in front of a Cover block, which creates a nice layered effect. I also inserted Custom HTML blocks within a Columns block to display different messaging depending on the time of day. (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31242051/show-content-based-on-time-of-day-timing-changes-on-different-days-of-the-week\">jQuery script</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/custom-html-1.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use Traditional Widget Layouts (Or Not) With Lots of Flexibility Over Title and Structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Classic widgets have always had a lockup that includes a widget title. One cool thing about having blocks in widget areas is that you have complete flexibility over how titles appear. For example, you might choose to have a title over every widget, you might only want one title at the top of each widget area, or your design might not need titles at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: Some themes, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/\">Twenty Twenty-One</a>, are designed to flow content horizontally within widget areas. If you’re having trouble with a theme splitting your layout into columns, you could try keeping the lockup together by containing it within a Group block.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=632%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Side-by-side comparison of List View of a Sidebar widget area with and without grouped/nested lockups.\" class=\"wp-image-11122\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?w=1760&amp;ssl=1 1760w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=1024%2C618&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=768%2C463&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?resize=1536%2C927&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/08/grouped.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Copy &amp; Paste Existing Layouts From the WordPress Pattern Directory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While patterns haven’t been fully integrated into the widget editors yet, one thing you <em>can</em> do is copy and paste patterns from the game-changing new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">WordPress Pattern Directory</a> into your site’s widget areas.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[musical interlude]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 0:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second of my big scary topics for this month. I&#8217;ll be talking about accessibility, which much like Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI in the last episode, is one of those areas where the work is never finished. Also, like DEI in last episode, I feel strongly about accessibility and the need for accessible experiences in the world, but I&#8217;m aware that this is an area where I&#8217;m still learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 1:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has both an accessibility statement and team, which makes a lot of sense given that the software supports so many different people, and industries, and cultures. But if you&#8217;re not quite bought into the idea that software should be accessible, or that accessible software can&#8217;t also be usable, then this is the episode for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 1:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I joined the WordPress project, the majority of my work with accessibility was in the context of the digital divide. Now, when talking about the digital divide, there are three concepts around quote-unquote, &#8220;getting things to people,&#8221; and those are access, usability, and accessibility. Sometimes these words seem interchangeable, but ultimately they have nuanced differences that address different problems. And I like to think of them this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access is making sure that someone can obtain something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usability is making sure that the user experience is understandable or coherent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And accessibility is making sure that it&#8217;s usable by the largest number of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always considered each as a subset of the one that came before it. So having something everyone can access is good, but easy to access and easy to use is better. Easy to use is good, but easy to use and easily accessible is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 2:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After joining WordPress, I discovered that accessibility in the context of software building is well, substantially more complicated. There&#8217;s no such thing as perfect accessibility, or a site that is 100% accessible, and many aspects are pretty open to interpretation. It turns out that accessibility, like so many things in WordPress, is a complicated intersection of art and science.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, there&#8217;s a rule that says, &#8220;Ensure that links are recognizable as links.&#8221; A fast shorthand to accomplish that, that we see all over the internet, is to underline all links or put that icon next to it that says, &#8220;This opens in a new tab.&#8221; You know that icon that&#8217;s a box with an arrow? That definitely has a name, that I definitely don&#8217;t know? That icon. [laughing] But those solutions don&#8217;t necessarily fit every context that you&#8217;ll find a link in, and that&#8217;s where we see that intersection between the art of communication and the science of necessity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 3:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you came with me earlier on the idea that accessibility is a subset of usability, and it&#8217;s not a far leap to say that the choices around accessibility implementations should always include design and the overall user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that some of you are thinking, &#8220;But we have guidelines! Like, that&#8217;s why we have the guidelines, so that not everything has to be a gray area.&#8221; And on the one hand, yeah, that&#8217;s true. There are a lot of guidelines. There are guidelines for the code, and what the code produces, and the design elements. But I worry that when a solution is driven solely by rules, rather than reasons, we run the risk of throwing out the good along with the bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 4:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility has been a consistent topic of debate in the project for as long as I can remember, and based on all of this, it&#8217;s really clear why. There are a few big picture questions that still deserve some sort of canonical answer for WordPress, and where possible I dig in and research the positions that everyone has taken in the past. But I also have questions about how to move everything forward, especially as the editing experience gets more and more standardized across the software, which reduces cognitive load, shortens the learning curve, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the future possibility for having a series of more niche admin interface options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would it be like to be able to account for functional limitations in a way that lets site builders select what is needed for their clients or organization, or just individual situations they know their sites would be maintained under?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What more could we do if part of the setup flow of WordPress was to select some bundle of potential add ons for neuro diversity, or colorblindness, or dyslexia, and more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really big question I have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 5:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to be really transparent here and share that my foundational understanding of accessibility and usability is 10 plus years old, and I learned it in the context of people in education, not software. So a lot of my questions about the future of accessibility and WordPress is the result of old knowledge exploring new spaces, which means they are a little untested. And I&#8217;m so grateful for the contributors who point out what the current research and thinking is, in this incredibly complex field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 6:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I normally like to wrap up the briefing with a tidy takeaway, but this particular topic doesn&#8217;t really lend itself to that. So I&#8217;ll leave you with this. I really believe in WordPress&#8217; mission to democratize publishing. And I, for one, will never stop learning about what gives people more access to the software, and what makes the software more usable, and especially how we can combine usability with accessibility in a way that puts form and function on a level playing field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[musical interlude]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 6:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thing one, it&#8217;s that time of year where many of our community members take a short break to relax and refresh. I&#8217;ll be taking a bit of a break during the month of August, and so the WP Briefing will return again starting in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thing two, huge thanks to the production crew that helps me make this podcast every couple of weeks, but a special shout out to our editor Dustin Hartzler, who makes quick work of all of my rambling thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 7:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Maybe you’re hearing about it for the first time, or maybe you’re testing and developing themes with it already. Either way, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here because it&#8217;s an exciting time for WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post provides a quick introduction to this new framework, and describes what’s possible by sharing a few practical tips and examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s theme.json?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, theme.json is just a file that lives at the top-level of a theme’s directory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceptually, it’s a major shift in how themes can be developed. Theme authors now have a centralized mechanism to tailor the WordPress experience for site authors and visitors. Theme.json provides theme authors fine-grained control over global styles, block styles, and the block editor settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By providing these settings and controls in a single file, theme.json provides a powerful framework that brings together many aspects of theme design and development. And as the block editor matures and adds more features, theme.json will shine as the backbone for themes and the editor to work <em>together</em> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png\" alt=\"💪\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Use it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the future! But if you’re like me, you might need something more tangible to be convinced. Here are a few reasons why you might use theme.json today:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Control editor settings like color, typography, spacing, and layout, and consolidate where these settings are managed.</li><li>Guarantee that styles apply correctly to blocks and elements across your site.</li><li>Reduce the amount of boilerplate CSS a theme used to provide. Theme.json won&#8217;t replace your stylesheet completely — there will be instances where CSS is needed to give your theme that extra flare (transitions, animations, etc.). But it can greatly reduce the base CSS needed from the theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of this post demonstrates a few theme.json configurations you can try out. The examples use the tt1-blocks<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/blob/master/tt1-blocks/theme.json\"> theme.json</a> — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tt1-blocks/\">the block-based version of this year’s default theme</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re starting with an existing theme, you might try copying a theme.json from the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/\">WordPress/theme-experiments repository</a> (for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/blob/master/fse-tutorial/theme.json\">the fse-tutorial theme</a> by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/poena/\">@poena</a>) and adding it to the root of your theme’s directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Change the typography settings of your site globally</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript;

Now you can add blocks both in widget areas across your site and with live preview through the Customizer. This opens up new possibilities to create content: from no-code mini layouts to the vast library of core and third-party blocks. For our developers, you can find more details in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Widgets dev note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Display Posts with New Blocks and Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop Block makes it possible to display posts based on specified parameters; like a PHP loop without the code. Easily display posts from a specific category, to do things like create a portfolio or a page full of your favorite recipes. Think of it as a more complex and powerful Latest Posts Block! Plus, pattern suggestions make it easier than ever to create a list of posts with the design you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edit the Templates Around Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the familiar block editor to edit templates that hold your content—simply activate a block theme or a theme that has opted in for this feature. Switch from editing your posts to editing your pages and back again, all while using a familiar block editor. There are more than 20 new blocks available within compatible themes. Read more about this feature and how to experiment with it in the release notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Three Workflow Helpers</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"496\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=632%2C496&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10988\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10988\" class=\"wp-image-10988\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=1024%2C803&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=768%2C602&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=632%2C343&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10989\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10989\" class=\"wp-image-10989\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=1024%2C555&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=768%2C416&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=632%2C517&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10990\" data-full-url=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png\" data-link=\"https://wordpress.org/news/?attachment_id=10990\" class=\"wp-image-10990\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=1024%2C837&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=768%2C628&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Overview of the Page Structure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you need a simple landing page, but sometimes you need something a little more robust. As blocks increase, patterns emerge, and content creation gets easier, new solutions are needed to make complex content easy to navigate. List View is the best way to jump between layers of content and nested blocks. Since the List View gives you an overview of all the blocks in your content, you can now navigate quickly to the precise block you need. Ready to focus completely on your content? Toggle it on or off to suit your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suggested Patterns for Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in this release the Pattern Transformations tool will suggest block patterns based on the block you are using. Right now, you can give it a try in the Query Block and Social Icon Block. As more patterns are added, you will be able to get inspiration for how to style your site without ever leaving the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style and Colorize Images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorize your image and cover blocks with duotone filters! Duotone can add a pop of color to your designs and style your images (or videos in the cover block) to integrate well with your themes. You can think of the duotone effect as a black and white filter, but instead of the shadows being black and the highlights being white, you pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights. There’s more to learn about how it works in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">For Developers to Explore</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=632%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10992\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1024%2C613&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=768%2C459&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1536%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=2048%2C1225&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Theme.json</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing the Global Styles and Global Settings APIs: control the editor settings, available customization tools, and style blocks using a theme.json file in the active theme.

rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a>. They answer questions from people across the world, whether they are using WordPress for the first time, or they’ve been around since the first release all the way back in 2003. These releases are as successful as they are because of their efforts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, thanks to all the community translators who help make WordPress available in over 200 languages for every release. 80 languages have translated 80% or more WordPress 5.8 and our community translators are hard at work ensuring more languages are on their way. If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And before we get started, I have to be honest with you all, this episode and the next one have made me feel really anxious. This one is about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open source, and especially in WordPress. And the next one is about accessibility in WordPress. And I feel like there&#8217;s just so much to do, and we don&#8217;t do enough, but we do what we can. And still, we will never be done with that work. And if you don&#8217;t know what I mean by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, you can kind of think of it this way. Diversity is bringing in people with different viewpoints and lived experiences. Equity is making sure everyone has what they need to get a fair chance of success, which is different from equality. And Inclusion is making sure that the environment is built to not only tolerate diverse groups but to celebrate them as well. So remember this as you listen to what I have to say here. We are never where we want to be in either of those spaces. But that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from looking at the things we have done to get us in the right direction. All right. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say a lot that we are a project that serves a majority collection of minority voices. WordPress is global in reach and open source in nature. And you would assume that what allows the software to be used by anyone would also enable it to be built by anyone. After all, your location doesn&#8217;t matter, and who employs you also doesn&#8217;t matter. And your relative social standing certainly shouldn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can communicate with the others contributing to the project, there should be no obstacle to your participation. The mission of the WordPress project is to democratize publishing, right? It&#8217;s to get the ability to have a website tap into passive income on your web presence. I mean, the job is to level the playing field for everyone. However, it&#8217;s my experience that bringing in new voices takes a lot of proactive work on behalf of leaders and contributors. It&#8217;s not enough to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having a party,&#8221; you also have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a party, and I&#8217;d like you to be there.&#8221; It&#8217;s not enough to think people will make their own space at this table. You have to make sure that you have table settings for everyone. And even beyond the basics of directing people to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on toward the next steps, you have to be honest about the fact that open source contribution requires a fair amount of privilege. By privilege, I mean the luxury of extra time or extra funding or just an understanding employer. WordPress supports 41% of the web. I think it&#8217;s 42% of the web right now. But less than 1% of people who use WordPress show up to help maintain it. And that 1% that does show up skews toward people who already have a pretty high level of representation and technology. And so, when you look at who is building it versus who is using it, it doesn&#8217;t always match. And since what we build so frequently reflects who we are, sometimes what we build doesn&#8217;t match the needs of the people who are using what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what has WordPress done to be proactive on the question of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? There are quite a few unseen things that have gone into this over the years and a few pretty visible things. This is a very long list. And it has a whole lot of just reference material. And so the show notes today will come in handy for people, and there will be just a laundry list of linked resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first thing that WordPress has done is that we have accepted the burden of proof. I&#8217;m going to share a post about this in the show notes. That means we accept that it&#8217;s not the job of underrepresented folks to figure out if they are welcome. It&#8217;s up to us to make it clear that they are. So, there are three big little things that the community has done over the years. One is that many teams open their text-based meetings with an explanation of what is done in the meeting, who comes to the meetings, where to find help if you&#8217;re lost in the meeting, and for teams that have a specific type of requests that comes into those channels that aren&#8217;t handled in those channels. They also will share where people can go to get those requests taken care of. Many teams have also updated their team handbooks to have good beginner docs, limited use of inside jokes or jargon, and good first bugs. And also, there is a code of conduct in the community declaring that everyone is welcome and clarifies what to do if you see folks being unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second big thing that folks in the WordPress community have done is written down what was unwritten. Having things clearly documented unlocks institutional knowledge that you&#8217;d otherwise have to know someone to get. Clarity and process and the structure help anyone engage with your organization, not just the people who have extra time to figure things out. What that looks like in the WordPress project is that many teams have documented their workflows and their working spaces and just their general team norms. Many teams have also started defining what it means to be a team rep and holding open processes to choose those team reps. Many other community leaders and I have written down countless unspoken rules, guidelines, and philosophical underpinnings so that people don&#8217;t have to guess what we&#8217;re doing or why we&#8217;re doing things, or where we want to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more visible thing that the WordPress project has been doing is that we found ways to invite people in, and they&#8217;re not failsafe; they’re not foolproof, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The first one is an ongoing, diverse speaker training initiative. And I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well. It is run by Jill Binder and a fantastic group of contributors that collaborate with her. And I really have loved watching that particular program grow and flourish and help WordPress make a difference where we absolutely can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that was pretty visible about how we invited people in was at the end of 2020, and we had an all-women and nonbinary release squad for our biggest release of the year; WordPress 5.6. I had a group of probably 70 women and nonbinary identifying folx who joined in the process and joined in learning more about the process. Some of them have continued in the project. Others have stepped away for various reasons. But all of them are welcome to return. And I encourage everyone to return to contribution when time and resources make that possible for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that we&#8217;ve done, which I have talked about a lot, is the revival of the testing and triage practices. That has been work that&#8217;s been ongoing for a number of years. And it happens across multiple teams. It is not always immediately clear to people why the testing work. And the triage work is identifiable for me as a way to invite people into this process. And so I&#8217;ll be briefly clear about it right now. So testing as a practice brings in the users that otherwise don&#8217;t have a lot of spare time and that extra privilege to like, figure out what&#8217;s going on with WordPress, and contribute their own fixes to problems. They can give back to this project by being co-developers with us, co-creators with our entire process of making WordPress real and usable for the largest number of people that we can because we now support 42% of the web. And then, the triage practice invites in a diverse voice of people. Because you don&#8217;t necessarily always need to know everything about a project to help with triage. And when you&#8217;re helping with triage, you get active learning through participating in the process. But you also get passive learning from the people who already know huge amounts about the project and the process and everything that goes into it. And so it&#8217;s a low key low stress way to get your feet wet and start building that knowledge that sometimes is hard to come by unless you are actively working in it. So the testing practices, the triage practices, I really to the core of my being believe that those are active and ongoing ways for us to invite people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get their voices heard in an open source project. And y&#8217;all, as I said at the start, y’all, there&#8217;s nothing about this list that I just shared, which makes me feel like our work on this is done. Just like any muscle, you don&#8217;t fight to peak fitness, and then hit the big stop button on time and say, &#8220;Now, I never have to work out again.&#8221; If we did, the world would be a very different place probably. But it does then lead us to the next steps for fostering a community culture that&#8217;s as broad as the people who use this software. If you believe in leadership at any level, as I do, there are a ton of things that you can do right now. But I&#8217;ll boil them down into three big chunks of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, check your community area, or whatever community you want to apply this to, for things that need a little more proactive work. I will share a post called<em> Building A Culture of Safety</em> that will take you through a list of good first steps. And it is not as hard as it looks. When you say build a culture of safety, there are many really clear-cut minor changes that you can ask people to make and, in like, four or five different areas that can help your community be more welcoming and more open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do is know that small changes add up over time and commit to making those changes where you can. If you are elite at any level, you know that supporting people and processes is the responsibility of everyone in the group. And if you can make your own autonomous decisions and commit to making small changes that make a big difference over time, you will be part of that solution. And that is not specific to any one group that we have in our communities. You can be an ally for anyone, whether they look like you, whether they have your same experiences, or not. And sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as just holding space for the people who haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk yet. And on the subject of holding space and the way that we communicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that I think is incredibly important is that you can take on as a foundational personal practice the concept of ethical communication. I&#8217;ll share a post about that as well in the show notes, but the core of it is that you have to know that what you say and don&#8217;t say what you do and don&#8217;t do has an impact on others and embrace that responsibility. All right, so you made it all the way through, and I am so proud of you. I&#8217;m sure you have questions about this. And I encourage you to share those. You can email them to me at wp briefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got two things for you today. First and foremost, WordPress 5.8 gets released tomorrow. It&#8217;s a big release, and lots of people have been working on it. So get your update processes ready and keep an eye on wordpress.org/news for the announcement post. Second, and still pretty important, team reps have been working on their quarterly check-ins so that all other teams can get an idea of what&#8217;s happening around the WordPress office. Keep an eye out for that post on make.wordpress.org/updates. And that is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re talking about one of my favorite parts of the project &#8211; WordPress events. The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 18:42:44 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 21:47:11 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211020175551\";}', 'no');

The team released its <a href=\"https://remove-unused-media.com/en\">Remove Unused Media</a> plugin as a commercial project for tidying storage space. I received a full copy of it and put it through the ropes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many commercial plugins, I am accustomed to the developers creating an entirely new menu item, taking up precious admin real estate. This happens even with those that just have a single screen too. However, I was happy to see the WP Ninjas team tucked everything neatly under &ldquo;Media&rdquo; as a sub-menu. We were off to a good start, and things only got better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I review plugins, there is one thing that I consistently preach: simplicity. That begins with following the core WordPress UI and sticking as closely to it as the plugin&rsquo;s features will allow. In essence, <em>don&rsquo;t make me think</em> about how to use your plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, Remove Unused Media got the user experience right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could nitpick a few design choices with the interface, such as modifying the list table with rounded corners and extra padding. The &ldquo;filter&rdquo; sub-navigation also deviates from the standard. And, the &ldquo;last analysis&rdquo; message should receive the WordPress admin notice treatment so that it stands out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all core UI elements with unnecessary customizations. However, they did not diminish the experience on the whole. The plugin mostly stuck with the WordPress standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real question is whether the plugin does what it says on the tin. <em>What is the experience of removing unused media like?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was easy. Users merely need to click the &ldquo;Start Analysis&rdquo; button and wait a few seconds. The plugin then has three tabs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unused Media</li><li>Used Media</li><li>Ignored</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Unused Media tab presents an overview of all media that the plugin could not find used on the site. There is a possibility that it missed something. However, I only found one old-school scenario where this happened, which I will dive into later.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Unused media screen.\n\n\n\n<p>From this point, end-users can manually delete individual media attachments or use the bulk-delete option. Before doing so, the plugin recommends making a backup of the site &mdash; solid advice for any such plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite feature of the plugin was not its primary feature of deleting media. It was actually the &ldquo;Used Media&rdquo; screen. Its &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How?&rdquo; columns break down where images, videos, and other files are used and in what context.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Used media screen.\n\n\n\n<p>It reminded me of the &ldquo;instances&rdquo; screen for the WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/version-1-prototype-of-the-wordpress-admin-block-directory-announced\">admin block directory proposal</a> from 2019. The concept showed where specific blocks were used across the site. Remove Unused Media does the same thing for media files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Ignore&rdquo; tab for the plugin keeps track of media files that should not be deleted, even if they are unused. Users can click a link from the other screens to add them to the list. This persists after running a new analysis too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin scans several third-party plugins like Elementor, Beaver Builder, ACF, and Yoast SEO. Some store media instances outside of the post content, such as in custom post meta, and Remove Unused Media searches those specific fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://remove-unused-media.com/en/pricing/\">Pricing</a> starts at 39&euro; ($45.38 at today&rsquo;s exchange rate) for one year of support and updates for a single site. It also has a five-site option at 149&euro; and a 100-site tier at 299&euro;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first version, the user experience felt solid. However, it does not have much in the way of customizability. That could be a sticking point for users who are looking for a more flexible premium option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Exploring Alternatives</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The plugin is not the first of its kind. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-cleaner/\">Media Cleaner</a> plugin by Meow Apps is free, routinely updated, and has over 40,000 active installations. It also has a commercial version with more features, such as third-party plugin integration, WP-CLI support, filesystem scan, and live-site analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Media Cleaner plugin results.\n\n\n\n<p>The UI for Remove Unused Media feels more like WordPress. Its &ldquo;Used&rdquo; tab also shows where (i.e., what posts) and how (e.g., content, featured image) specific media files are used across the site. This feature alone makes it worthwhile for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One area where Media Cleaner shines is its option for ignoring (not deleting) attached media. This is a vital feature if users have ever added the old <code>gallery</code> shortcode. At one point, WordPress simply displayed all attached images as a gallery. Eventually, it specified the IDs in the shortcode. However, for those older instances, this was not the case. Without enabling this option, those media items might get queued up for deletion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Remove Unused Media plugin does not have such an option. Attached images that are not explicitly used are considered unused. This may not be an issue for most users, but those with old gallery shortcodes should be aware of potential problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The baseline features for both are similar. Remove Unused Media gets the edge in its default user interface and experience. However, Media Cleaner has many more options for customizing how the plugin works. Plus, users who cannot afford an upgrade can always run the free version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say either is better or worse than the other. Both were solid options in my tests. I just want to merge the best features from each, snagging the interface from Remove Unused Media and the configurability of Media Cleaner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 01:31:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Adoption: Levels One through Five — Page Builder Summit, October 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?page_id=19119\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/gutenberg-adoption-levels-1-5-page-builder-summit-october-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:446:\"<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Thank you for attending my talk at the Page Builder Summit! 💕</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow-up from the Page Builder Summit October 18 &#8211; 22, 2021 and the presentation: &#8220;<strong>Customizing WordPress Block Editor for Client Projects</strong>&#8221; by Birgit Pauli-Haack </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Video is still rendering</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 15:15:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Build Notification Banners With ElmaStudio’s Latest Block Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124460\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:191:\"https://wptavern.com/build-notification-banners-with-elmastudios-latest-block-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=build-notification-banners-with-elmastudios-latest-block-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5840:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">A friend and I were discussing the need for more one-off block plugins earlier today. He had mentioned that WordPress has this powerful block search feature that rarely turns up anything useful. Most are part of collections that do not appear in the results. This was part of a more wide-ranging conversation that I am sure I will tackle on another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it reminded me that I had a couple of ElmaStudio&rsquo;s block plugins sitting in the backlog along with some notes on them. The team released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aino-accordion-faq-block/\">Aino Accordion FAQ Block</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aino-notification-block/\">Aino Notification Banner Block</a> three weeks ago. The latter piqued my interest more so than the former.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting an error notification.\n\n\n\n<p>The two-person team of Ellen Bauer and Manuel Esposito could have continued amassing a collection within their existing Aino Blocks plugin. Instead, they took a turn down the path few have traveled. They are now releasing single-purpose blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We plan to work on smaller add-on single blocks from now on as well,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-second-look-at-elmastudios-aino-theme-and-companion-block-plugin#comment-392898\">said Bauer in the comments</a> on my last <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-second-look-at-elmastudios-aino-theme-and-companion-block-plugin\">review of their theme and block library</a>. &ldquo;Blocks that are needed for building more complex block page templates.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notification boxes are so commonplace that you almost wonder why they are not a part of core WordPress. Many block collection plugins bundle one or multiple, but it is hard to find a solid solution as a single block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block has six statuses that users can select from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Welcome</li><li>Info</li><li>Help</li><li>Success</li><li>Warning</li><li>Error</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each status has its own icon and default colors. The colors are customizable, but the icon itself is not. I am a fan of the decision because it means one less choice I must make. There is also an option to hide the icon and switch between fill and outline versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing different notification statuses.\n\n\n\n<p>The block also displays a &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo; button for visitors to close the banner on the front end. The state is not saved, so if the visitor returns to the page, it will reappear. I would like to see an option to store the banner state in the browser in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the plugin for its simplicity. The default output works well enough for most themes, but it has enough options for users to customize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming site editor is where the plugin could really shine. Of course, a user would need a block theme to use it there, such as ElmaStudio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/aino/\">Aino</a>. The block offers a quick and easy way of plopping something like a sales banner across the top of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a sales banner at the top of the site.\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a few nit-picks, of course. These are not <em>OMGBBQ</em> problems that make the plugin unusable. Instead, they are places where it could be improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because many themes use a top margin approach to vertical rhythm, it can disrupt the alignment of the icon and paragraph. The plugin should zero this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anyone else runs into this issue, the following CSS is a quick fix:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block-ainoblocks-notification-block .content-wrapper p:first-of-type {\n    margin-top: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the downsides to the plugin is its custom system for borders and padding. From a development perspective, I prefer the plugin&rsquo;s system under the hood, which uses a curated set of values that keep a user from doing something really crazy. It offers a balance between flexibility and rational choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The plugin&rsquo;s custom controls.\n\n\n\n<p>I have argued that most design controls should have such a system &mdash; the same one that is in place for font sizes and colors &mdash; <em>ad nauseum</em>. However, Gutenberg and core have moved in a different direction, preferring arbitrary user-defined values over a range of presets. Plugin authors should fall in line for the sake of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a user, I prefer consistency. I want the interface to be the same, regardless of whether I am dealing with a core or third-party block. Having to learn multiple methods to add padding or change a border creates unnecessary friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s custom system also conflicts with default block styles that theme authors can define in their <code>theme.json</code> files. The standards set by WordPress create a bridge between plugins and themes that the platform has never had before. The more block developers follow it, the easier it is for theme designers to work within the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other options. In the past week, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/alert-box-block/\">Alert Box Block</a> plugin landed in the directory. It provides far more icon options and more design controls in general. However, its UI is so different from the WordPress standard that I cannot imagine using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk about issues with Aino Notification Banner, it must be taken into context. I point out problems because I see its potential. I want the developers to continue iterating on it, improving what is already one of the best options out there. This is something that ElmaStudio has proven it can do with earlier projects, so I look forward to what the plugin looks like in the future. For now, it is a solid option for users who need to display notification boxes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:08:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Contributors Propose Renaming Reusable Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:175:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-propose-renaming-reusable-blocks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-contributors-propose-renaming-reusable-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4106:\"<p>WordPress&rsquo; Reusable blocks may soon be <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34352\">getting re-named</a>, as the feature&rsquo;s distinct capabilities are less recognizable from its name following the introduction of patterns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Gutenberg project first took off, nobody had any idea how important patterns would become in the page building experience, or that they would be getting their own directory on WordPress.org. During a demo at WordCamp Europe 2021, Gutenberg lead architect Mat&iacute;as Ventura commented on how transformative patterns have been for making page design approachable for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was a smaller part of the roadmap initially but it&rsquo;s becoming a centerpiece &ndash; especially because it allows&hellip;world class designers to provide a starting point for users and users get to learn design as they are interacting with themes,&rdquo; Ventura said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, patterns have made their way to the forefront of theme design and development with an excitement that rivals <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2006/02/25/wordpress-widgets/\">the introduction of widgets</a> in WordPress&rsquo; earlier days. WordPress 5.9 will feature <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31153\">pattern insertion</a> directly from the Pattern Directory so users will be able to change their patterns as often as they like, without having to switch themes. Coming in Gutenberg 11.8, the pattern inserter will <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35115\">highlight featured patterns from the directory</a> in the initial view, instead of displaying the first alphabetical category. Contributors are also considering a path for allowing themes to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35364\">surface specific patterns from the directory</a> instead of bundling them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In light of all this activity around Patterns, Reusable blocks are in need of a renaming that is more descriptive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;In the end, patterns are also&nbsp;<em>reusable</em>&nbsp;pieces of design,&rdquo; Ventura said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Given the nature of these [Reusable] blocks is to have content in sync wherever it&rsquo;s displayed &mdash; edit once; update everywhere &mdash; I propose we change the name in the UI to &lsquo;Synced Blocks&rsquo; and adjust the block description a little bit to clarify that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI for Reusable Blocks is confusing because it is built on top of assumptions that users know the intricacies of how they work. WordPress developer Lee Hodson <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31163#issuecomment-898376830\">summarized the problem</a> and how the current UI leads to reusable blocks being accidentally edited:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The save reusable blocks dialog is nice but how many creators actually understand what this save dialog means? On the surface it looks as though everyone should understand the save/not save option but it&rsquo;s meaning is only obvious when you understand that reusable blocks are (currently) meant to either (a) not be edited or (b) edits to them are meant to affect all instances of the same block and (c) that reusable blocks can be converted to editable blocks (and not everyone immediately understands the difference) when edits to reusable blocks are meant to be independent of the block&rsquo;s template.</p><p>I feel that a nice idea (reusable blocks) has been very badly implemented and many creators are blissfully unaware of its pitfalls until they realize their &lsquo;template blocks&rsquo; have been overwritten.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Several contributors participating in the renaming discussion concurred that &ldquo;Synced Blocks&rdquo; would be a better name for the feature. This suggestion is the frontrunner so far. The conversation is still open and consideration of this proposal has been added to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27890\">Reusable Blocks Improvements</a> tracking issue.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 21:50:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 18: The Economics of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11351\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/episode-18-the-economics-of-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20740:\"<p>In episode 18 of WP Briefing, Josepha Haden Chomphosy reflects on a recent lecture that she gave to students at Hendrix College in which she explored the economics of WordPress and the principles that sustain the project&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today marks the start of Digital Citizenship week. This year in 2021, it is the week of October 18th, and to kick it off, I want to share with you a bit of a lecture that I gave to a college class last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An economics professor teaches this class. And so, a little bit, I went to talk about how WordPress is essentially a microcosm of global societies. That was mostly why I was invited to come and give the talk. But one of the students asked a really interesting question about economics, and especially the economics of WordPress. And so, I&#8217;m going to take some time to do my best to answer that question here as well. But first, we&#8217;re going to start with some big picture information about WordPress that I shared with the students, and then maybe you also don&#8217;t necessarily know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first place that we started was with the question of what WordPress is. Most of them had heard of it but didn&#8217;t necessarily have a good handle on what it is. And so this is the definition that I gave to them. This is a bit of each of the facets of WordPress that we kind of see right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, WordPress is, of course, a content management system, which means it&#8217;s a piece of software that uses a copyleft license, which means that it&#8217;s open source, and no one individual necessarily owns the rights to the code. If you get very specific, WordPress is, of course, a FOSS project or a free and open source software project. I know that there are discussions around when a piece of software is free, then what are you using to pay for that piece of software or to pay for your access to that software? And often, the answer is that you&#8217;re using your personally identifying information to pay for something commonly referred to as the data economy. If you&#8217;re not familiar with that, it&#8217;s a little bit of a three-pronged effort there. So you submit your data to get access to the software, or you can join the platform, depending on what it is that you&#8217;re working with. That platform or that software collects your data so that they can build a profile about what sorts of content engages you and so that they can share, essentially, audience cohorts like groups of people that kind of are talking about what you&#8217;re talking about, agree with what you agree about, and find interesting, the same sorts of things that you find interesting. And then those companies sell access to your attention. This is something that I refer to as the attention economy. I think there are a lot of startups at the moment that refers to the attention economy. The most iconic recent example was when the folks over at Netflix said that they weren&#8217;t competing against other streaming services; they were competing against sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that might ring true for quite a few of us at the moment. But anyway, to scoot us back one level, I had, as I said, WordPress is free software. But the difference with WordPress is that to get a copy of WordPress, you are not necessarily required to hand over any data. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone data to get a copy. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone money or data to open up a copy that you own or to build a website in it if you&#8217;re just doing it locally, but especially around that data side because WordPress is not collecting any data, we&#8217;re also not brokering access to anyone&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another answer to the question of &#8220;What is WordPress?&#8221; WordPress software and the project enable nearly half a trillion dollars of revenue in the global digital economy, as we learned from a recent study from one of the hosting companies inside the WordPress project&nbsp; &#8211; oh, Inside the WordPress ecosystem anyway. And WordPress also runs 42% of the web, with some of the biggest sites we know using WordPress. Such sites like the New York Times, Rolling Stone, many, many others, which you can see in the WordPress showcase as well. I don&#8217;t necessarily want to just like call out all the big groups that use it. But it&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;To recap what we just learned about WordPress and what WordPress is. It is software that one uses a copyleft license, meaning no single entity owns it. Two, it is available at no cost, meaning no money changes hands for you to own a copy. Three does not track you, which means that you don&#8217;t have to give WordPress any personally identifying information to get a copy. Four is an enabler of a massive digital economy massive portion of the digital economy even. That, you know, means their services, extensions, themes, plugins, all of that stuff. And five, it is software that supports 42% of the web. Practically every other site you visit uses the software. So that&#8217;s WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this massive free software, you might be thinking to yourself a couple of things. The first thing you might be thinking is, &#8220;Well, that sounds impossible.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re thinking, you may be thinking, &#8220;how is it possible that a software that is technically owned by no one and takes no money or data to obtain &#8211;&nbsp; how is it that a software like that can power 42% of the web.&#8221; This brings me, of course, to a topic that I specialize in, which is how WordPress is made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is, by now you know, built by a global community of contributors. And it&#8217;s partially contributors that are self-sponsored or giving of their own time freely, and partly sponsored volunteers, people who are paid by Five for the Future initiatives inside various companies. I have said many times, most recently at WordCamp US, that I have an ideal ratio of about two to one in that kind of volunteer or self-sponsored versus corporately sponsored set of voices. And also, as I said, at WordCamp US, we’re not necessarily getting to that ideal ratio right now because of the nature of the way the world is at the moment. However, this community functions almost like a tiny little digital society. There are ways to get your voice heard ways to take on leadership roles; there is a little bit of light governmental structure. And as with any society, any community like this, there&#8217;s a relationship inherent there. There&#8217;s almost a transactional element that takes place when you&#8217;re participating fully. Although I know that for the WordPress project, especially for open source in general, there is a reminder that we should always be contributing without the expectation of reciprocity. But even if you are contributing without the expectation of reciprocity, you still are engaging in an existing community, which means that you are fostering a relationship with the community or with the people who are also participating in the community with you. It&#8217;s just inescapable if you have people around and working together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two concepts really informed my work to future-proof the WordPress project. And the first one is digital citizenship, which is why this particular WordPress Briefing fits today. And the other is the Tragedy of the Commons, especially how we go about refreshing those commons. So digital citizenship, I talked about it a bit in the last WP Briefing. But it&#8217;s still true today that that&#8217;s important. And the thing that really matters to me as we are working through how to make sure that WordPress is moving forward together. But most discussions of citizenship are location-specific, which makes plenty of sense. However, with so many mobile devices and broader access to some level of internet, we have increasing opportunities to be connected because of interests or skill sets. And even the things that we aspire to or aspire to be with a community like WordPress, which has no home office or main location. Of course, it&#8217;s very important that all of the leaders in WordPress, all of the team reps in WordPress, are proactively engaging with the people in their teams and in their portions of the community instead of waiting for like happenstance running into people. We also use a bunch of social stuff to get people together: twitch screams, not twitch screams because it&#8217;s not that Halloweeny! Twitch streams, hallway hangouts, events that are both online and off. Everything that the Learn section of the community is doing with their discussion groups. There are so many ways that WordPress proactively engages with each other and engages with itself. And that work is all really important to keeping the community involved, which is key to any organization&#8217;s long-term success, and certainly is true for WordPress as long-term success. Because when your community or your organization or your society is engaged and invested in your collective success, then you are (get ready for a list) one, more likely to see obstacles early and be able to overcome them, two more likely to see upcoming trends and prepare for them, three more likely to see what is broken and be able to repair it before it is a major issue. And four, you are more likely to be a resilient and fruitful organization long after any single member has stopped participating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more connected to the community you are and the more active, the greater your influence and the ability to affect changes also become. And so, not only is it important for us to remain connected as a community just to make sure that everything is going well. But also, it&#8217;s one of the primary ways that people who are giving back can sort of have more of an opportunity in this particular ecosystem. In open source, anyone can gain influence by helping others by helping the software and by keeping the trains on the tracks. And so, one of the only lasting limits to long-term potential in an open source project is how good you are at seeing beyond yourself and seeing what good action can make beyond just your own benefits. I understand that there are also specific hurdles to contribution in your free time that I have dedicated a couple of different podcasts to, so I don&#8217;t want to neglect that reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found in my experience that one of the limiting factors that sometimes cannot be unlearned is not being able to see kind of a broader scope, a broader perspective than what you&#8217;re already bringing into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So being a good digital citizen, that&#8217;s a really important part of keeping any society together any organization together and moving forward. But especially is in the context of digital citizenship, is true for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that is really important to me is this concept of the Tragedy of the Commons, which is, of course, an economics term, open source has borrowed. We have talked about it in this podcast in the past. And today, I specifically am talking about how WordPress works to consistently be refreshing the commons. So the theory of the Tragedy of the Commons says that all societies can withstand a certain volume of free-riders. A certain number of people who reap the benefits of that community’s society without necessarily putting anything back into it. And that is no different in open source than in any other place where you would apply this concept. The particular catch for WordPress is of course, that it is free, freely available and has no specific copyright holder. And so in those circumstances, it is incredibly easy for a small group of people to maintain the software while the whole world uses it for free. And not only is it possible for a small group of people to maintain it, but if you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s also easy for a small group of unpaid people and unacknowledged people to maintain something forever. And at the volume that WordPress operates at, that&#8217;s a really risky choice. It doesn&#8217;t help to support those people; it puts the long-term stability of the software in jeopardy. And at the end of the day, it just does not help to replenish the commons to make sure that everybody keeps getting to have the benefits of this ecosystem in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many of you know, there is this program called Five for the Future. And that program is essentially modeled after a tithe. So the invitation to this program when it was first introduced in 2014 was that if you or your company or your community is made better or made possible by WordPress, you should give back to the WordPress project 5% of your resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an aspirational 5%, of course, and some groups give back their time while others give back with their money. But almost anyone who wants to give back has some skill that WordPress needs. That particular program has really grown in leaps and bounds since it was introduced. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many team members were considered Five for the Future contributors when it was first introduced in 2014; it was a little before my time. But at the moment, it&#8217;s about 150 people that I am routinely aware of or in contact with, which is still a small number considering how many people use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many corporations who have seen the most benefit, including, you know, the company that I work for (Automattic), and a lot of other hosting companies in the ecosystem, all do a really good job of refreshing the commons so that WordPress is still usable for businesses of all levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to leave us with one final big picture thought about open source. This is going to be a callback to one of my earliest episodes in this podcast. But I think that it&#8217;s always worth remembering. We&#8217;re going to talk about this really popular phrase in open source projects &#8220;free as in speech, not free as in beer.&#8221; And for WordPress, as you know, it&#8217;s a little bit of both. It&#8217;s literally free. But also, since it&#8217;s open source, it has a free as in speech component to it as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four freedoms of open source as laid out in the 90s. So 10 years into the open source movement, are basically that you have the freedom to run the program for any purpose, the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so that it can do your computing as you wish, the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help your neighbor and the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to learn and benefit from the changes that you put into the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember if I said this in my original podcast, but I&#8217;m going to say it today, free speech has a lot of responsibility, just like being a part of a community. Governments or communities, or in our case, this software is built by the people who show up. For WordPress at 42% of the web, every small choice we make can cause huge changes in how people experience the web today and tomorrow. And that, to my mind, is really no different than participating in any sort of civic infrastructure. The changes that are made today, or the errors that we prevent, set the tone and the circumstance and the potential to thrive for everyone who comes after us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>18:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us into our smallest of big things. I just have a couple of things for you all today. Firstly, at the time of this recording, this is prior to the Go/No-Go demo meeting for WordPress 5.9. So I have no idea what&#8217;s happened. But by the time this podcast has been released, we will have had the Go/No-Go meeting and also have shipped the post that summarizes what happened, what we hope to change in the next essentially sprint so that we can confidently move forward with a clear set of features for the 5.9 release. I will include a link to the notes below in the show notes. Kudos to everyone, props to everyone who participated in that meeting. And also props to all the people who have been helping us as we head into this final release of the year and all of you who are going to help us make it successfully to the end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing I already kind of alluded to at the top of the podcast, it is Digital Citizenship week; two or three years ago, the WordPress blog had a series about digital citizenship and what it means to be a good digital citizen, what it means to do that in the context of WordPress. I will drop a link to those posts in the show notes as well. They are very well written and very important, and fairly evergreen content. If I think that there is something worth updating, I will update it before putting it in the show notes. And that is your small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you all for tuning in today for the WordPress sprint. I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:141:\"Gutenberg Times: Changelog #53 – WordPress 5.9 Go/No Go decision, Gutenberg releases 11.6 and 11.7, and Themes and Styles for the Editor￼\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=19322\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/changelog-53-wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-decision/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58603:\"<p>In this episode, Birgit Pauli-Haack and Grzegorz Ziółkowski discuss WordPress 5.9 Go/No-Go Decision, Gutenberg Releases 11.6 and 11.7, and ongoing discussions about Themes and Styles for the Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li><li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li><li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li><li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paulisystems.net/wordpress-consulting\">Pauli Systems</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/changelog-53-wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-decision#shownotes\">Show Notes </a>/ <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/changelog-53-wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-decision#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-19322\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">Gutenberg Changelog</a>&nbsp;podcast via your favorite podcast apps!</strong><br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/620NwVKQJGdTupy36zYxvg?mc_cid=4b6c9f88fe\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9ndXRlbmJlcmd0aW1lcy5jb20vZmVlZC9wb2RjYXN0\">Google</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gutenberg-changelog/id1469294475\">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pca.st/podcast/f8445ec0-7508-0137-f267-1d245fc5f9cf\">PocketCasts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/gutenberg-changelog\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|<br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/chi7j-9904a/Gutenberg-Changelog-Podcast\">Pod Bean</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://castbox.fm/channel/Gutenberg-Changelog-id2173375\">CastBox</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/gutenberg-changelog-878239/\">Podchaser</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/podcast\">RSS Feed</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Announcements</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://app.mypodcastreviews.com/podcasts/k7H9zO/reviews/7420388\">Review by Jorge Calle, Ecuador</a></li><li><a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/3416344753630/WN_v-EXlrFaRcabGz78jgj8CA\">Oct 28, 2021 &#8211;

In today&#8217;s episode we will talk about so much, WordPress 5.9 go/no go decision, Gutenberg releases 11.6 and 11.7 and ongoing discussions on themes and styles and editors and everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, sponsored by Automattic. I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziółkowski, code wrangler at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. How are you, Grzegorz? How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m great. I had a blast during my vacation. I want to tell you more about it, but we have so much to cover today that there isn&#8217;t much time for chit-chat. How have you been lately, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Well, I had a blast running live Q&amp;As this week and last week and the week after next and talking to developers and users. You&#8217;re right, let&#8217;s catch up after the show and let&#8217;s get this started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowsk</em>i: Yay. Before we start we want to thank you, Jorge Calle user name, AtrumGeost from Ecuador for his five-star review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hooray. We are so thrilled to have you as our listener. Jorge wrote, “the best all-the-things Gutenberg podcast. This is my favorite Gutenberg and WP-related podcast. It helps me keep up-to-date with all the new and upcoming changes and to understand the reason behind those changes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s so nice. That&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re trying to do. Thank you, Jorge. Greetings to Ecuador.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, we could put that as our mission. Yes, greetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yes. All right, we have a few announcements because it&#8217;s been a while. The next live Q&amp;A, put this on your calendar, is a discussion with the BuddyPress team on how they converted classic widgets into blocks. We learn what was hard and got easier over the first two times I did it. Join us on October 28th at noon Eastern, 1600 UTC with Mathieu Viet, David Cavins and Varun Dubey on the live Q&amp;A show. It&#8217;s going to be really, really interesting, especially for developers who still are a little bit on the edge to jump into Gutenberg development, also theme developers who have widgets in their themes. It&#8217;s definitely going to be educational because we will have some demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I guess it should be also useful for the developers who have plug-ins and they still waited to convert them to blocks because it&#8217;s all about that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Right, right. Everything needs to be a block now. It&#8217;s just so much better for the users to use them because everything&#8217;s just one concept, they don&#8217;t have to do the mystery meet with what are widgets, what are menus, what are sidebar and all this kind of thing. Yeah, speaking of live Q&amp;As, yesterday I had the privilege to host a discussion among WordPress giants, Mark Jaquith, core committer for 17 years, Helen Hou-Sandi working on WordPress for 10 years and Riad Benguella who is the newbie in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: A rookie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: He&#8217;s already working on Gutenberg for even five or even seven years, so &#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Five. Five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Five years. They discussed how can we make building blocks easier. It was a follow up on a Twitter thread Mark started with a question, what if building custom blocks for the block editor was as easy as supplying attributes and a block of HTML? What if this produced react editing code and PHP rendering code without a build stack? Coincidentally enough, he and Riad independently of each other were exploring some technical avenues for that and Helen was too. Grzegorz, you know more about the technical framework and underpinnings of Gutenberg, what was your take from the discussion yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I was really excited to see this discussion happening in the forum where people have more time to express their ideas, where they come from, what&#8217;s their use case and how they arrived at similar conclusions which is the best part of that. All three people, they were working on different aspects. Riad is working only on core, mostly on core and Helen is doing work for customers, same as Mark. Basically different venues came to the same conclusions. It&#8217;s really nice that we have good understanding where it should all go now. Those ideas that they both shared are pretty decent and I guess this is something that should be materialized in the future. That should greatly benefit all the developers that increase blocks on a daily basis. It was really cool and I encourage everyone who is doing block development to catch up with this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also check the references they mentioned. One is from Riad, it&#8217;s on his GitHub, it&#8217;s called Block, we will provide links. Mark, he also has the same idea, I believe it&#8217;s called Blocksta, the code name. Yeah, that&#8217;s really insightful from my perspective. I learned a lot, especially about the background, all the friction people have and the pain points. It&#8217;s something that, as a core team member, I heard a lot about that, but it was more on the side of showing what&#8217;s wrong and not necessarily what are the challenges people have on a daily basis that end up with all the frustration they share, which is very limited, especially on Twitter which is a few characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. I also like that both Mark and Helen expressed and emphasized that the ideas that they had on how to do some templating and all that would not have been possible from the beginning because you need some underpinnings already working and some expansion of the API. Mark mentioned the block API version two where PHP and JavaScript have the same information about blocks, that was necessary to actually even think about any of the additional helper function, tool function for block editing and block writing or building. They also expressed that it shouldn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not necessarily something that needs to be in core, but it could be one of the official tool building for plug-in developers. Yeah, it was a really good discussion. I will also share in the show notes Helen Hou-Sandi&#8217;s blog post called exploring custom blocks from a PHP-centric developer UX point of view where she even more elaborated on where she was coming from from the agency work there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordPress 5.9 Go/No Go Decision</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, definitely. I could continue on this topic for long, but let&#8217;s go to the most important announcement of the day which is the go/no go decisions. The meeting happened yesterday. The official post isn&#8217;t ready yet. Yesterday will be October 14. We spoke with Matias and Hector Pietro who attended the meeting. It looks like all the features discussed during this session should be included in the WordPress 5.9 release which means that block themes will be supported as an option with how they call it, a remark that there will be something like early access or something along those lines just to build proper expectations for users. At the same time it&#8217;s worth to mention that the new Twenty Twenty-Two theme built out of the blocks will ship with WordPress. Therefore, the default experience with themes for all new websites will start with blocks. I think it&#8217;s huge and super exciting to see it happening finally. They took so much time, but there is more. Do you want to say something about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Well, I just wanted to notice that the theme Twenty Twenty-Two was actually introduced last week by Kjell Reigstad and he&#8217;s working with Jeff Ong on it. We will share, of course, the link in the show notes, but if you want to check it out it&#8217;s on the design, actually on the core make blog, very buried but it&#8217;s beautiful. He also has some ways how he can change the theme.json and then make the theme a total different look than what he&#8217;s originally planned there. It&#8217;s really nice. You had more to say about the go/no go from Matías Ventura?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. No, you sidetracked my brain now for the Twenty Twenty-Two theme. It&#8217;s really beautiful. I really admire the work done with that, especially because it was very challenging on the technical level. We had to build all the blocks to make that happen but the outcome is really good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also would like to bring to your attention the issue that was created today by Matías which contains a series of bugs and shortcomings that he faced during preparation for this 5.9 go/no go decisions meeting. We will share a link to the issue which has the number 35662. It only confirms that there aren&#8217;t any significant bugs that put too much risk on the roll-out plan, however it will be essential to sort out those minor issues because they might negatively impact the first user impression. One more thing to mention is that you all will be able to watch the progress of the release execution in the traditional way which is through the issue, through the project board which is Gutenberg and the name is WordPress 5.9 must-haves. The project number is 62.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Thank you for the summary there. There&#8217;s actually a video that you can, it was a one-hour meeting and they recorded it, it&#8217;s available on WordPress.TV. I wanted to go still for those who &#8230; the plan, the schedule of the release. Feature freeze will be November 9th, that&#8217;s 42 days after go/no go. From today on it&#8217;s 41 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Or even 40 because the meeting was postponed by one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Oh right. Right, right. It&#8217;s actually 39. Beta one will be released or is scheduled to be released November 16th and then the release candidate one is scheduled to be released on November 30th. The final release is scheduled for December 14th, 2021 and will have, from the Gutenberg plug-in releases, the latest one will be 11.9, all the versions from 11, or 10.8, or 11.0 I think to 11.9, release candidate. 11.8 will still be a normal release on Gutenberg plug-in and then 11.9, the release candidate, the features that are in there will be then merged with core and then bug fixing starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just also want to mention that before the go/no go meeting the group working on the navigation block and editor screen, navigation editor screen held a hallway hangout so to speak. Among other things they concluded that the navigation editor screen itself is not ready for 5.9. Only the navigation block and the block for new navigation and I think it has some &#8230; I don&#8217;t think it has a feature for existing menus, so we need to see about that, the main reason why they won&#8217;t solve the underlying backwards compatibility issues successfully before the release. A menu is a major part of a website. There are a myriad of third-party products tapping into the current features and they all need to be accommodated in one way or another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a summary post about that on the core blog, we&#8217;ll share the links of course and there&#8217;s also a video where you can also follow along on the meeting. We will share all the relevant links for the 5.9 at the current stage in our show notes, that&#8217;s a summary post of the meeting, Matías&#8217;s roadmap, Josepha&#8217;s planning post and then the meeting recording as well as the summary post by Hector Pietro. That&#8217;s about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. Just to summarize, the navigation block is going to be included, right? It&#8217;s crucial to have it for the block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yes. Yes, but they were still trying to figure out if they need a second block for the backwards compatibility or they want to put it all in one block. They concluded now that they don&#8217;t want to burden the new feature, the new navigation block with the legacy part from 18 years of WordPress development so they are working on a second block that is the compatibility, that handles the compatibility issues. Also, some of the plug-ins actually tap into the navigation editor screen as well and the customizer so there are so many different branches of what to think about that they said, okay, we need to take a step back and see that we&#8217;re not making the same mistake that happened with the widget editor where they weren&#8217;t having enough tests with the third-party plug-ins to get this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s about the release. I&#8217;m totally excited about it, especially because of the block theme with the full site editing. We will have some new or old terms. I think we were always talking about the block-based theme, it&#8217;s now called block theme. We were talking about the site editor, or template editor, now it&#8217;s the editor. We were talking about the global styles, they&#8217;re just the styles because, yeah, that&#8217;s all there is. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Everything gets simplified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Simplicity is to aim for, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Even the user experience that the blocks provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, and….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Okay. Let&#8217;s move to another point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Move on. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordCamp US 2021</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. WordCamp US, I didn&#8217;t watch it live, I watched some talks afterwards. How about you, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: I watched it live. I took the day off from other work so I could really concentrate on that. My favorite talks were, I couldn&#8217;t decide on the favorite so I have three favorite talks. One was from Rich Tabor from Extendify, his talk was building modern WordPress sites, the interplay of blocks, pattern and theme.json. That&#8217;s definitely a very good presentation to watch, not only because all his slides were so beautiful and his voice was so soothing, we were all very relaxed about all the new things that come to WordPress, but he also made very clear how all these things work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I saw also that some people were confused whether it&#8217;s an advertisement for WordPress or is it an actual talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Then the other one was a voice for the new White House Administration with the block editor by Helen Hou-Sandi. It was an hour-long presentation but it had a few different parts in there. One was making clear the advantages between a form-based content collection screen to the what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor and how they accomplish that. They actually built custom blocks, they did that for the experience. Then Helen, in the second part of it she also went in and explained why native blocks, Gutenberg blocks are so important. Then went on to actually show how she coded one of them and made the difference between the different, showed the difference between the approaches that they were exploring and where they finally settled. She has actually some code examples in there and she walked us through her set-up. That was really good. There was a lot of things packed in there, but it was one whole presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the last one was Kjell Reigstad who showed us creative uses of block styles. Block styles is something that you use the core block, but you add additional CSS to it. That&#8217;s pretty much what block styles are. He showed how to do this, he also shared his repository, but he did all kinds of different graphical and animation. It was just beautiful to see what is all possible with just using block styles. You don&#8217;t have to do a whole lot of programming from that, at least not in JavaScript or in PHP, you need to do a lot of CSS for that. A lot of designers know that part and I think it&#8217;s a good starting point to get your creative juices going. Yeah, how about you? What did you watch on the rerun?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I watched all the talks you mentioned so you took my picks. Anyway, I have one more to share, the one from Cory Webb, software engineer at Fast. He had a talk named the demystifying Gutenberg blocks, understanding first steps to becoming a Gutenberg developer. I really liked the talk because it was structured in a very nice way. It covered all the APIs, basic APIs you need to know to start with blocks, but he also added a section where it was nice to know and there&#8217;s some additional going further if you want to extend your knowledge base and there are some other topics. That&#8217;s a good way of approaching that and it will be super beneficial for anyone who either already started working with blocks or they want to start because it covers all the levels when you want to become a master going from the beginner and scaling your knowledge. I liked that about this talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. If you watched that you have all the pieces that you need to go from beginner to experienced. That&#8217;s also a part of my talk that will be shown at the Page Builder Summit that starts on Monday from Nathan Wrigley and Ann le Roux. There are a lot of talks there on the professional use of page builders in all areas. Ann is doing her full site editing talk and I&#8217;m going to talk about how to customize blocks for client projects. If you missed it, last week was also a theme developer live Q&amp;A. Ellen Bauer, Anders Norén and Carolina Nymark were on the show. Anders showed his block theme, Tove, and Ellen Bauer showed her studios theme, Aino, as a hybrid theme. I loved their excitement about the new possibilities of themes and blocks and full-site editing. They also shared how they made the journey from building classic themes to going block themes now. They also answered a ton of questions from the audience. The recording is available on YouTube and we will try and post a transcript and resources on the Gutenberg Times next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I started listening to this live Q&amp;A as well, it was pretty good, but I was driving so I couldn&#8217;t show the demo so I stopped. I didn&#8217;t have to time to go back, but I definitely have to. One thing that caught my attention was that Anders mentioned that one of the users of his team, he applied a lot of modification using styles and similar things. He sent a link to show the end effect. Anders said that he didn&#8217;t recognize this theme, he couldn&#8217;t say it was his. That&#8217;s a great thing about the future of building themes, the user will be so much empowered to achieve their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Right. Yes. Yeah. Speaking about themes, there is a new site out there called wpblockpatterns.com. It&#8217;s a place where you can find out how your block patterns or the block patterns in the directory look with any of the block themes that are in the repository. I did a few tests and I&#8217;m delighted to see that block patterns will persist even when you switch the theme on your site, so something that&#8217;s very hard to do with third party page builders but that&#8217;s also very hard to do with classic themes where you sometimes lose content just because you switch themes. Now with block patterns that&#8217;s a much better build and they all persist, including the design, when you switch the theme. It&#8217;s really interesting to see. Speaking of block pattern, there&#8217;s a small change in the pattern directory. The meta team has added now a featured category so the best patterns you can look up in the featured category. You can also select them from the inserter inside of the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another community contribution came from Marius Jensen. He updated his plug-in called persistent block editor settings. He added support for the following user settings, block breadcrumbs, that&#8217;s the breadcrumbs on the bottom of a screen, on and off, change the most used blocks to what the user actually is doing and the caret positioning. Then all the settings are stored in the individual user profile information on the site so that persists between computer or browser changes. I think it&#8217;s a great plug-in and many, many people have asked for that. It has quite a following on the WordPress repository. I also think that sooner or later, I know that the core team is working on something like that, but it&#8217;s still blocked by some of the not finished things I would say. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. It&#8217;s in progress for so long. There were several approaches that tried to address that. Maybe it&#8217;s good that it didn&#8217;t happen before because now we will have several screens for the editor and that brings another level of complexity. Still, the way it&#8217;s structured, even in the local storage of the browser, so it persists per browser at the moment, it&#8217;s still something that might change slightly at the time of the WordPress 5.9 release. Starting from that, I guess it&#8217;s a very good moment to finally bring the same functionality to core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned this, I was just &#8230; you were distracting me because I was counting the different editor screens that we have now and it&#8217;s quite a few. It&#8217;s a post editor, it&#8217;s a widget screen, it&#8217;s a template editor, it&#8217;s a template parts editor, it&#8217;s the reusable block editor. It&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a lot. I mean some of them are the same editors behind the scenes, but conceptually they are different. Now, as we will cover soon, we also have this zoom mode so you can switch in the editor as it will be called from now on from a full template view to the template part view, so that&#8217;s yet another way of looking at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.6</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well finally, half an hour into the show, we are at the releases. Gutenberg 11.6 was released on September 29th. The WP Tavern covered some of it and of course some of it is also in the &#8230; oh, the WP Tavern actually had two posts about it. One is about the release as a whole and the other one was introducing the new API for locking blocks. I think that was one of the major features there. Let&#8217;s go through that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with the query pagination now can use the flex layout which is really cool. The site logo now has the feature to crop the image. If your logo that you uploaded is not fitting in the spot you can crop it. Now it&#8217;s also possible to zoom and rotate the image, so that is really a step forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There is this item for gallery block which is at toolbar bottom to convert old galleries to new format. I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s something that will stay for longer, or is it something for the transition period, but it&#8217;s great that this is now possible because it will help with the ongoing efforts to bring inner blocks for the gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack:</em> The gallery block has experienced a refactor, instead of just having the IDs of the images in there and then rendering them it actually comprises now of single image blocks that you can add all the different features that you have with the image block also to the single image in a gallery block. You have then the gallery outer and then the inner blocks are image blocks. The roll-out is, in that regard it will not automatically convert the old to the new galleries until it&#8217;s rolled out and until it&#8217;s coming to core because right now it&#8217;s still an experiment. You can switch that over to the new gallery. It&#8217;s called update, the button in your gallery toolbar and then you can convert it to the new format. I think in the final roll-out, when you open up the post it will automatically convert it, but not with all the previous. It will not touch that unless you really wanted or unless you edit that particular post. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the color picker got changed and is rolled out, it&#8217;s more accessible and it also has a copy function and all that. It also makes the rounds now, we saw it in 11.6 as well as in 11.7, that&#8217;s gradually exchanged on all the blocks. Do you know anything else about the color picker?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, I know that there is a big redesign happening. I don&#8217;t know why, but there&#8217;s always a reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think it was accessibility problems that the old color picker had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh. Maybe, as far as I remember that was something that was worked on before, WordPress 5.0, which was a long time ago. I&#8217;m sure it was accessible enough to get through to the release then. Maybe there was some concerns that are addressed now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Now there is a simple styles preview in the sidebar of the template editor or site editor that you can modify some of the styles in your panel and it also now uses a navigation component. That&#8217;s just the underlying feature for the global styles preview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. For the preview you see some characters and it shows the typography, how it looks in practice and also the colors that are applied to that. It just gives you a slight preview so you don&#8217;t have to navigate through the page and look for that. It&#8217;s pretty useful in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. You see the final version of it right now in the video from last night&#8217;s meeting of the go/no go when Matias Ventura was demoing it. It&#8217;s a nice &#8230; also with additional color palettes. It has received quite a few iterations since it got added to the plug-in. Full site editing, there is now basic support, the executive word is basic support for child themes when you have a block theme so you can have different features added or switched on and off in your child theme that maybe the parent theme doesn&#8217;t allow. You have different color settings and any settings that you want to you can do in your theme.json for the child theme and still get updates for your parent theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. The feature that I mentioned a few minutes before is a way to edit template parts in a special view. When you are editing your template you can use this dropdown menu which is an icon with three dots. There is this new option, edit template part. When you click that, everything disappears but the template part and you can focus on editing only that area, which is pretty handy. In the context when there is a lot of blocks sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see when the template part starts or ends. I like this addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>APIs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Then we come to the lock control for block type level. As we mentioned there&#8217;s an article that covers that as a whole at the WP Tavern. At the attribute level it supports locking the block from being moved or removed and it hides the block moving errors and the delete button if the block is locked. You can use that also with your &#8230; it&#8217;s just an attribute in the block.json if I see this correctly. You can also use that for your block patterns. That can have locked and unlocked blocks. That&#8217;s-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh yeah. That&#8217;s true. That would be a good use case, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s also something that Matias demonstrated yesterday, last night in the video. What else do we want to point out from the 11.6? Bug fixes, well we&#8217;re going to jump over the bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I think you had something highlighted for the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, the experiments. The experiments, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Basic plug-in support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Sorry. The site editor now has basic also, our executive word is basic plug-in support. It adds the support for the plug-in sidebar. The site editor is now the editor and that&#8217;s where you do the full site editing pieces. The sidebar there can now be targeted by plug-ins for the sidebar, for the menu items in the menu as well as close and open general sidebar action. Plug-in developers, extenders will really be happy to hear about that. We were waiting for that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a big push for documentation updates, especially for the packages and the components. Developers can now look up some of the documentation and don&#8217;t have to figure out from code what does this do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I guess there were also some updates related to how to contribute to the WordPress components package. That&#8217;s the most important part that builds all the experience, all the UI elements and so on. There&#8217;s a lot of movement in that area which also shapes how global styles look. You can see a lot of changes in that area. That&#8217;s all because of these efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right. Code quality, I think that was all &#8230; was that all that we wanted to say about 11.6 in this episode?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 11.7 Release</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I guess we have a lot of cover also from 11.7 that was released on October 13th. It would be fair to say that we are done with the 11.6 release and just move to the next one because it was a huge one and there was a lot of enhancements included in this one, way more than the one we already covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me start with the changes to the block editor. With the work, ongoing work on the navigation block and all the child blocks there was a need to have a way to use also slash inserter in this content. So far you could do it only through the paragraph block, which was quite a big limitation. It is now fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s enabled to some of the links to the blocks that allow you to insert links and stuff like this. When you insert a link and it has some name, when you delete that name and write a slash then you will be able to insert a block, other types of blocks that fit in that context, which is pretty good. This is something that is still, the API behind that is still experimental. Every block author there can experiment with that by enabling the flag called underscore experimental slash inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think what that also does is give you a little input screen from the slash inserter, not that you have to &#8230; up until now the slash inserter only added, gives you fast access to adding a block, but now you can actually add also some parameters to that and enter it right there. That&#8217;s a real speeding up the workflow quite tremendously. As you said, any block can have that so it&#8217;s also the plug-in, the blocks that come with plug-ins can also use that. That&#8217;s really good, immediately extender friendly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has added or enabled the ability to create pages directly from the inline link UI on the navigation bar. The new empty page gets created, that&#8217;s a feature that comes over from the other editor screen but I think I really like how they implemented that, the new empty page gets created behind the scenes with a title set on the text typed in the search input field. That&#8217;s definitely also a fast way to create a menu when you know you have the outline of your website and you just create the menu headers and then it automatically creates all the pages for it as well. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. At the end of the process of creating your navigation you just go to those pages and fill it with content, which is pretty nice. It should speed up the whole process really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Exactly. Yeah. In 11.6 came the site logo cropping and image manipulating features, now you also get, with 11.7 you also get duotone support which means that you can have a fixed color scheme around your website. Every image that you have might fit better into it. Really that&#8217;s a cool thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. Exactly. There&#8217;s more for the columns block, they enabled the block gap feature which we covered in past episodes. When it&#8217;s combined with vertical margin support you can have a really nice effect, so finally you can add some spaces between columns and there is a control for that which allows that and some nice animations that support that. It&#8217;s a very nice way that was missing for so long. Now it&#8217;s finally implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. If you&#8217;re a theme developer who has actually taken out the gap between the columns, you can now, it can now be done through the interface. I saw some nice animations or demos where you have three columns that are a different color but they don&#8217;t have a boundary so they go from one color to the next without the background color of the site shining through which is quite a nice effect when you just want to liven up the text, the wall of text when you&#8217;re writing so much and just have some graphical play around with it interspersed there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The navigation, oh yeah, from the navigation block you can now transform your link into other allowed navigation blocks. You can transform it into a sub-menu, menu or a site logo or a home link or a social icon, which is cool if you change your mind on some of the links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m not quite sure what happened with the content. For instance, if you have a site logo and you want to transform it into something else, which probably will have a different URL, it might be it uses just the same URL and then you just need to edit that. Anyways, it&#8217;s a really interesting idea to speed up the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Well this one is actually only going from a link to something else, not the other way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The initial idea that I always, that stuck in my mind, all the transforms should be two ways. If you convert from something you are able to convert that back. Maybe it&#8217;s now relaxed, you can always use an undo button and that should be pretty much it. I guess it&#8217;s whatever makes it easier for the user is fine from my perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think I need to press that for this if there is a way going back, just from a social icon link to just a mere menu link. Maybe it&#8217;s a different context here. Yeah. Now you can actually &#8230; there was a problem when you have these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Just to explain that, why the rule was like that, when you are transforming from the heading to the paragraph then you use the same content and it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. However, if you would like to go from the image to cover block then you have only the image, but as soon as you add some heading or something like that in the cover image, when you go back to the image block then it isn&#8217;t quite sure what should happen with this heading. You could lose some content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. No, I get it. Yeah. I&#8217;ve only been situational, but I&#8217;ve never had a situation that I have already a cover block and only want to go back to an image. I think that&#8217;s just a lack of imagination I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Also, when you&#8217;ve invested so much time to polish your cover block and make it pretty, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense to go back to the image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s so true. Yes, yeah. The next item on our list is show none as an alignment option and use contextual text to clarify the settings. There are now hints included in the alignment options, spread text maximum wide, 720 pixels wide or something like that. It explains a little bit to the user what does it mean when you change something to align wide or to full width. Some users had trouble to see, I&#8217;m one of those, to see that you can uncheck those alignments and then remove it. Now there is and option that says no alignment, just do what you normally do as a block, don&#8217;t make it wider or go out of the content. I think that&#8217;s a good addition there because I got totally and utterly confused. Oh, I can switch it just off. It was not a good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, you had to click on the same option again to disable it, which wasn&#8217;t so straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: It wasn&#8217;t clear. That&#8217;s a toggle switch, that wasn&#8217;t clear. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I wanted to emphasize that the number you mentioned is not something that is hard colored, it depends on the theme. It is able to, the context there provides very useful information which can vary between themes, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Is that coming from the theme.json file do you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: They probably compute it on the fly using some JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah. All right. That&#8217;s great, but we&#8217;re not done yet. What&#8217;s the next thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Format library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: This is one of the options you have when you have text based blocks. Before it was only possible to change the foreground color of your text, so change it to something different. Now there is also an option to change the background color or the highlight how it&#8217;s called in other tools. The change was applied to the existing controls so now you have a pop up dialogue, I don&#8217;t know, which has tabs so you can switch between text and background and apply those different colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: I think that&#8217;s a feature that has been missing from the beginning for a very long time. There was something that you could do in the classic editor very easily with the little toolbars up there that you can just highlight a word in your text within the paragraph and then give it a different text color or give it a different background color. The text color was still there, is already there, but now you can change the background color of that. Yeah. You find it at the same place where you also find the text color change in your paragraph toolbar. You can now, as a theme developer you can now also set presets on the duotone for your theme. If you say every duotone, when it comes out of default, should be a blue filter or a pink filter or something like that, you can help your user to set the right duotone on certain images in the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. You can change it per block, so that&#8217;s pretty nice. You can say, oh, site logo, I want to have it in a red filter and that&#8217;s also possible now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. The possibilities become endless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. In general all the management for colors becomes so complex that now it got extracted, the color palette is in its own global styles screen. Basically you need to, when you go to the editor for editing, for changing your site, when you go to the styles sidebar, now you need to first click on the color link and then it will show all the colors you have. You can also drill down to the palette or individual elements to change those settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: As the next iteration, probably not for 5.9 because it takes a little more, but one of the features that will come is that you can, in that you can also have multiple color palettes to choose from or have a color palette directory where you can grab a wonderful &#8230; yeah, Matt Mullenweg actually mentioned that in yesterday&#8217;s video that there is a colorpalette.com site where you can pick the color palette that you like and then you get all the hex decimal values for it for your site. That would be so cool to actually have a source like that that can pull in new color palettes for your theme there or for your site. Yeah, this has opened so many possibilities, it&#8217;s really mind-boggling. Right now we just have these three screens, all the styles, the color styles and then the color palette separate where you can add additional colors to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really hard to wrap your head around how colors work at the moment. If I am correct, now you have the default colors that come from the WordPress core, then you have theme styles that every theme can provide and it looks like you can also, the users can define their own colors right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. The hierarchy is users first, then the theme, then the core, but it&#8217;s also that the theme can say please disable custom colors, my users don&#8217;t know how to use color.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: To offset or to avoid the GeoSitters interesting page designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> To make it even more advanced, it&#8217;s also possible to say that, a theme author can say that for this particular block I want to have a different color palette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haac</em>k: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There&#8217;s also something new and I didn&#8217;t realize that until now when I see the screenshot that I was looking at here from the post. In the styles there was, up until 11.6, with the new version now you can actually go directly to the blocks to change their settings. Before you had to close the sidebar from the style, from the global styles and go back to &#8230; when you do template editing you have to go back to the blocks sidebar. There wasn&#8217;t a clear path for that. Now you can, I see here blocks is another panel that you can open there. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, next thing, the template editor got some new workflow things. There&#8217;s a back button now for the isolated template part editor. When you drill down you can go back up the rabbit hole again. Then also the template areas have added some template details like header and footer areas there. That&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: When you go to the header and you click on the name of the template you are currently editing, you not only see the details about the theme template but also some details about template areas used in that template which allows you to quickly navigate to them because there are dropdown menus with additional options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Exactly. Yeah. Then the navigation screen still in experimental has a new feature that you can add tool tips to navigation items in their set-up states. That is interesting and helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I guess it&#8217;s coming from the block editor. When there&#8217;s something wrong, the link is missing in your navigation where it should be, then it just underlines it with the squiggly line. When you hover over it it just shows you what the issue is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. You don&#8217;t want to have in the menu a link or a menu item that doesn&#8217;t go anywhere. That helps you too. Then the next one is insert the navigation link blocks by default in the navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Basically, when you click on the plus sign to add another item, you can start writing and it will show you a list of matching links. You can just click on one of them and that will add it to the menu. You don&#8217;t have to choose the type or you don&#8217;t, give me category page, no, we just type the name of the link and it just does everything behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s a very nice feature because in the current menu screen you really have to know what kind of type you&#8217;re looking for. This goes away right away with that feature. I&#8217;ve got to test it, what happens with custom post types and post categories or are these pages also being surfaced. Yeah. Wow, that was a lot in this release. Do you have anything else? I think that was it, the major parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. We had to cover two Gutenberg plug-in releases pretty packed with features. I guess that&#8217;s a lot already to process for our listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yeah. In one sitting, yes. Let&#8217;s go to the active development and what&#8217;s discussed. I wanted to highlight again the gallery block refactor will come out of the experimental stage with the next plug-in release, that&#8217;s 11.8, that&#8217;s in two weeks. It will be in 5.9, WordPress 5.9. At the moment we&#8217;re doing the extender outreach to plug-in and theme developers to alert them to the changes. If you are one of those and/or you work for agencies but you don&#8217;t have public plug-ins or themes in the repository, then I would suggest to go to the developer note that Clan has already published a month ago on the changes so you can see if that affects your gallery handling in your theme or your plug-in. We will have it in the show notes of course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then on the FSE Outreach Program update Anne McCarthy has another call for questions where you click on a button and have your question and then it gets sent to her inbox and then she finds the answers for that and she will publish all the questions and answers in a post later on. The deadline for getting your question in is October 27th, that&#8217;s in two weeks. Then she will, within a week, publish that post. This is also for 5.9 when full-site editing comes in with early access there that you can get your questions answered, or also your fears, either way is fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I think we should also include a link to the previous installment and all the answers. I think there were about 50 questions answered. That was a lot. Maybe that would be also good to check. Maybe you already have answers for your questions and you don&#8217;t have to reach out again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. I think the reason that Anne does it now at this stage is because the last one was at the beginning of the year. With the, I don&#8217;t know, six or seven plug-in releases that happened since then, quite a few things have changed, some irritations that were &#8230; because it was annoying or it was an interface that didn&#8217;t make sense, you had questions there, but that has been already fixed so the new questions certainly also in regards to the go/no go decision, I would wait until the post is out, to read through it and get &#8230; some of the answers might be in that summary post from the go/no go meeting that Hector will publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then also from the FSE Outreach Program was the summary of the theme switching experience. It was a great read. There were quite a few theme developers who had some expectations there that also went through, some site owners went through the testing and had some surprises there. Channing Ritter on the design team did some nice mock-ups on how to make it a better experience. It might not be part of 5.9, but it&#8217;s definitely something that you who sent in or did the test have influenced how the next steps are going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, get your questions in, think about the gallery block refactor and then live Q&amp;A October 28th with the BuddyPress team members on converting classic widgets to blocks. This is the end of our show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I wanted to remind everyone that we are waiting for more reviews and that&#8217;s always great to hear from you what do you think about the show. You can also ping us on Twitter or send DMs with questions, with the feedback, whatever you&#8217;d like to talk about with us. My handle is GZIOLO and Birgit is BPH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauii-Haack</em>: Yes. As always, the show notes will be published on <a href=\"http://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast\">GutenbergTimes.com/podcast</a>. If you have questions and suggestions you can also send them via email to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelong@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelong@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Well, it was good to see you. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re back from vacation and rested and ready to go. Thank you so much for being here and a big thank you for our listeners to stay with us so truthfully into another long episode. That&#8217;s it for me. Goodbye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Thank you, Birgit. Thank you everyone for waiting four weeks for the next episode. See you in two weeks.

We’re recording this on September 16th, 2021. In today&#8217;s episode we will talk about the planning scope and team for WordPress 5.9, the roadmap for WooCommerce blocks and of course this week&#8217;s Gutenberg 11.5 release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, WordPress developer advocate and curator for Gutenberg Times. Again, I&#8217;m delighted to have with me on the show co-host Grzegorz, or Greg, Ziółkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. Hi, Grzegorz, how are you doing today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hello, Birgit. I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;m looking forward to my vacation that starts this weekend. I&#8217;m going to Greece. It&#8217;s first time since two years going abroad, so I am really excited but also not so happy about all the paperwork that is necessary to travel these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, with all the COVID and vaccines and all that kind of thing, is that what you&#8217;re referring to with paperwork?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes. I have five forms to fill in for myself and my family. It&#8217;s strange. I guess you know that because you traveled from the States to Germany a few weeks back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, we did. I scheduled my test that I have to do because the United States changed how they let people in. Now I have to have a test that&#8217;s not older than three days to get in although I&#8217;m vaccinated. It&#8217;s strange. It&#8217;s all strange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, yeah. At least I don&#8217;t have to do any tests because I&#8217;m also vaccinated. That&#8217;s on the good side here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, on the way in we only needed to show our vaccination records and be done with it. On the way back it&#8217;s going to be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, we start our episode today with an announcement, with an announcement that Josepha Haden Chomphosy published the preliminary planning for WordPress 5.9. That&#8217;s supposed to be released December 14, 2021. Yes. It&#8217;s again just before the holidays and many sites will wait until January to update, but most sites it turns out update right away. We did this, had this exercise now for the last four years I think as far as I can remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes, even WordPress 5.0 was released on December 8th, 9th, I don&#8217;t remember exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 6th?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Maybe 3rd. It was in December and we had the same discussion, why it&#8217;s happening just before Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We are a worldwide project, it is not only Christmas for people, some people don&#8217;t even know what that is and they just have their own holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The world does not stop when WordPress releases. We found that out with 5.0. The internet did not break and everything was going smoothly. I know there are a few US agencies that want to close down over Christmas and they just &#8230; yeah, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a hard sell for them to say we do all the upgrades in January when we come back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s perfectly fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think so too, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, as they did for 5.8, there will be a go/no-go decision for what will be in the release. That is scheduled to happen on October 12th. That&#8217;s about four weeks ago, in four weeks, sorry. That&#8217;s in four weeks. The feature freeze will be November 9th and then beta one is supposed to be ready for November 16th. People get cracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I think this series is a bit smaller in the scope, so I think that those dates make a lot of sense. I think the schedule for the 5.8 was a bit longer, especially between the feature freeze there was two weeks, but at the end of the day I don&#8217;t think that matters that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mostly not for Gutenberg because you patch back to the WordPress right away when you have bug fixes, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope follows pretty much what Matías Ventura published earlier this month as the preliminary scope, so we will have blocks with intrinsic web design, then the navigation menus, interface, the user interface for the theme JSON. Theme JSON was introduced for theme developers for 5.8 and 5.9 will have the first version of the interface so users can also configure their themes and their block editor through that. There&#8217;s also refining of editing flows for block themes, a new default theme and additional design tools from the block editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are a few, Josepha called them hopefuls that might get in but they might not get in. Part of it is the pattern insertion and creation features so that you can submit patterns to the directory and then also insert them directly from the inserter. Right now you have to click the copy button and then copy/paste them. For 5.9 the meta team is aiming for insertion into the block editor. Then also unzip/rollback fail-safe, there&#8217;s a whole team working on that, more PHP unit tests and then improved compatibility with PHP 8.0 and 8.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The last three items aren&#8217;t related to the Gutenberg at all, but in some ways they improve the overall quality on WordPress core, so it&#8217;s maybe somehow related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Right. Yeah. That&#8217;s that. The team is, release lead is again Matt Mullenweg with Josepha being the coordinator I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And the marketing team lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the marketing team lead, yeah, with that. Who else is there already in the posting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I&#8217;ve seen that a few days before and the list was still missing a few names. I don&#8217;t know if it was updated since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That was quite a while ago. Here we go. September third was it published. The team, to go back to that, release lead is Matt Mullenweg, marketing and comms is Josepha Haden, technical writer is Jonathan Bossenger and those are the leads that are filled in. I think the rest is going to come together when the meeting is, the board chair meeting later on. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes. There&#8217;s still time to volunteer if some of our listeners want to jump in and help with the release, even as people who just watch the process and be ready for the next major release to take this leadership role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Josepha asked for volunteers for triage lead and the release coordinators. If you don&#8217;t triage the bugs or the tickets that are supposed to go into 5.9 and see how they&#8217;re going you&#8217;re not going to get a release together. The coordinators are really important to get all the teams ready and working on this. I think there are a few volunteers already on the post in the comments section, but you can still throw your hat in the ring. That is about 5.9. I think the next date for that to watch is October 12th with the go/no-go because that will determine what exactly will come into the release from the navigation screen, new navigation blocks, see how far the gallery block, the new gallery block, refacted, is going. That&#8217;s still in the experiment. There are a few other things that might or might not come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>Yeah. I think the most important one would be the navigation block and the navigation screen. That&#8217;s quite a huge project that has evolved for quite a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think over almost two years. It&#8217;s also, I just saw and we&#8217;ll see it in the updates later there are some discussions going on that our listeners might want to chime in in terms of backwards compatibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We promised also a Woocommerce roadmap regarding blocks. Darren Either from the team put a nice blog post together with a lot of information about that, what is happening and what is in the near future or what is soon happening. The high priority is to build robust blocks for checkout and cart, the shopping cart, that not only gives the store and their customers a much better user experience but also allows for extensibility for third-party tools. The blocks will become the default way to handle checkout and carts soon. They were a little bit cagey with dates and something, but it&#8217;s definitely something to watch out for. They will also have, for the transition, fallbacks to shortcuts and the shortcuts for cards and checkout and then if the extension isn&#8217;t optimized for blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. We will include also a link to the GitHub repository that contains all the blocks. There are a few of them. They are very advanced I must say. In the WordPress core we have a lot of blocks, however they are more on the side of editing content so the complexity comes only in the block editor, whereas Woo, they do something really impressive on the front-end so those blocks are interactive, they are optimized in terms of performance. There&#8217;s some really impressive work on their side. I&#8217;ve been watching that for quite a while, this is in the works for over two years now, and they are improving. Their initial implementation, it was mostly bringing back compatibility from shortcuts, that was transitioned from shortcuts to blocks. I remember the first prototype, it was creating the safe implementation, the short code and that was just not working. Their block editor experience was the change but the rest has stayed the same. They have evolved in so many ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also shared some ways for the users and shop owners, the checkout flows are now much more smoother and that leads to better conversion rates, which is the whole goal of this concept. It&#8217;s also, now you have the ability to preview how cart and checkout looks from the editor. It sounds, in our context when we talk all the time about the block editor the preview is something you just take for granted, but here we are, it&#8217;s improvement in their workflows. They were also talking about the iterations they are doing and how they are trying to use InnerBlocks to structure or architect their blocks. That&#8217;s also a great way when they are presenting in the post how it empowers users to add their own integration pretty easily. You have now a checkout form and you can inject any type of blocks, you can add a heading in any place you want, you can add, I don&#8217;t know, an image. Whatever you like you can add there and also reorder items like change headings. It&#8217;s something that wasn&#8217;t possible before and this just opens new possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also happy to see that this flow is now becoming the default one, because it was present but it was only for some extensions that were in Woocommerce store by default. Now it&#8217;s open also to plug-in others. That&#8217;s the biggest change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I really like how Darren put the post together. He has many, many screenshots in there so you get really a good picture of what&#8217;s going to happen. Check it out. There&#8217;s also some work being done to prepare Woocommerce for the site editing feature that&#8217;s coming to 5.9 somehow, or 6.0. I think it was good for the Woocommerce team to wait until the block editor was a little bit more stable and had more features for extensibility. I&#8217;m glad that they found it now worthwhile to put it together and that the user experience is up to the quality that they wanted to. That will open up the signal also for other plug-in developers and also gives quite a nice set of example code that you can study if you are into reading code. As Greg said, we&#8217;re going to share not only post the show notes, but also the GitHub repository so you can check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I have the last announcement, then we get to the release, our next live Q&amp;A on the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel will be October 7 at 16:00 UTC, 11AM Eastern and 18:00 Central Europe Time. Sorry. Got all the times mixed up again. That is pretty much the story of this week for me. I go either way and I always go wrong, so I need to read it and pronounce it right. October 7, 16:00 UTC. We will discuss with experienced WordPress theme developers how they transition from building a classic theme to a block based theme and using theme JSON and also full site editing and the global styles as far as it&#8217;s already available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will have as a guest Ellen Bauer. They published just recently their Aino theme. That is their block based theme and they have additional features in there that will cover that. Carolina Nymark, who&#8217;s on the themes team and also worked on the 2021 blocks, TT1 Blocks theme, that&#8217;s the block based 2021 product. She also has a site called full-site editing where she teaches full-site editing to theme developers. It&#8217;s great to have her on the show. Then the last one is Andres Norén who designed the 2020 default theme last year. He&#8217;s working on a new theme as we speak. Oh yeah, by the way, his theme Eksell is actually powering the Gutenberg Times site for, I don&#8217;t know, half a year now. I&#8217;m glad to have those two, Ellen and Carolina and Andres, on the show on October 7th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I think the line-up is just so great. I&#8217;m looking forward to this Q&amp;A session. I think you did a great job convincing all the people who have so much experience building full site editing themes to be on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m really happy that they all make the time to educate our community on this. Also not only to be on the show, to take the time, but also take the time and work through this because we all know that, if you are an early adopter, you basically do all the bug testing and quality assurance for the team, but you also have to invest a lot more time because of course documentation is not yet complete or changes. It&#8217;s a major undertaking and I&#8217;m glad that these three are coming to the show and telling us what they have found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. There is also this bright side that you are on the bleeding edge of innovation and you are part of the process and you influence how this all shapes up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think it has more pros than cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, absolutely. Looking back, the three years, block editor, most of the early adopters have had, really a jump on the new technology and, yeah, were supported by big acquisitions or hired just right away because of their expertise that they have shown. It will be similar to theme developers that are early adopting these new features, even if it&#8217;s a little bit of a heartache or a headache, more a headache. It&#8217;s the cutting edge, indeed. Sometimes it&#8217;s the bleeding edge, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. In this context, which makes me very happy, is that all three invited guests, they are in the community for quite a while and they seem to be aligned with the vision and they are adjusting their themes to be up-to-date, which is really impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, they totally get the vision. All three of them have published quite a bit of their learnings. Yes, I will share a few links in the show notes so you can check them out, but definitely sign up for, register for the live Q&amp;A so you get also your questions answered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.5</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the Gutenberg 11.5 release. We are, as of today there is not a final release yet because there&#8217;s some problems with the build sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s some turbulence like during the flight. I mean everything is ready, it&#8217;s just the process didn&#8217;t end up successfully and it&#8217;s more of the technical challenge of the release process itself than something is wrong. Yeah, I hope at the time when this podcast will be produced and ready then the release will be out, hopefully today. We said the date for recording before assuming that everything goes out on Wednesday as usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Well there was, the 11.5 release candidate is out or has been out for a week, so that&#8217;s what we are basing things on. There weren&#8217;t any changes on it from the features or the PRs, it&#8217;s just the build process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. We have a few new features. Do you want to talk us through it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. Let&#8217;s start with the block support changes. In the previous episode we mentioned that gap block support feature. That was still an experiment. It was implemented on the team JSON side, but it was disabled by default. Now we have this support, there&#8217;s a UI for that. It&#8217;s pretty simple. In the dimensions panel, if I recall correctly, we have this control that allows you to change the gap between blocks. The name is still to be settled as far as I know because it has some, in the world of design there is something similar that might be confusing, but it was, you just change the numbers and it just increases the spacing between blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related to that there is also a change in the group block. At the moment the group block has this layout option, layout control that allows you to change how it is presented. By default it just uses, every block in the group is in its own row, however this new feature is just integrated with the inserter that inserts a group block with every block in the same row. They are aligned, next to each other in one line, which is pretty nice for some complex designs. This is just, it was there in the group black, it&#8217;s just the new way of discovering this feature in the inserter, in the slash inserter when you are typing in the prompt in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s the first implementation of the Flex layout that I think Riad actually put the basis in for with 11.4. Now this is the first iteration where one block is actually using that. Of course there will be more. In the PR, if you want to follow up on that, there are some links back to the Flex layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but I think the Flex layout we talked about one or two episodes before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah, but there was not a block that came with it out of the gate. It&#8217;s also part of what&#8217;s in 5.9 being the intrinsic design of pages. There will also be, another change is actually that the bug report form, which is one of the most important forms on the GitHub repo, has received some changes. The ones that are here in that release are more cosmetic but I wanted to point it out, the new template feature of GitHub is now used and they created a new bug report form to remind people of all the information that would be helpful if someone would take on an issue to fix it. I encountered quite a few issues where we needed to find out what actually the user used, what versions they are or what are the steps to reproduce it. Those are very important information. If we have to read minds what&#8217;s actually happening, we might not get to reproduce the error or the quirkiness that is and we have to go back and ask for further information. That is just delaying the time of the fixing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the form is now much easier and you don&#8217;t forget anything. I also wanted to point that out for those who are in the GitHub repo. Let us know, or let the team know when there is something to be fixed or not working right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a nice change. Usually it sends up someone needs to ask for more details. After a few weeks, if there is no answer, the issue is closed, which isn&#8217;t something we really want. It is just the reality because we cannot reproduce the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s no questioning the experience of the person who posts it, it&#8217;s just we need to see it, we need to be able to reproduce it to locate where the code change needs to happen to actually fix it. It&#8217;s just saving a lot of time and being very specific in what&#8217;s not working. Yeah. Yeah. Next the block library has got some new enhancements. One of them is using the block gap between column blocks, so that is another iteration of a new feature. Now you can….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but this has only changed on the CSS level for now. As the rich table in the PR set, it&#8217;s a stop gap for block gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nice, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Fun with words. Yeah, but that&#8217;s the direction, I guess. Most of those layout related blocks should start using those design controls, elements, to make the experience more cohesive. That in general is the direction where it&#8217;s heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. There was an article in the WP Tavern about what controls somebody could use, should use or should be having out of default and not changeable, who&#8217;s having control over themes? I think there were some misunderstandings. Matías went into the comments section and clarified a few things regarding that. If you come across an article go into the comments and see what Matías has to say as well. Matías Ventura, the spark of Gutenberg, just to reiterate that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video block got an enhancement to use the existing video poster image on insert. The video block has become quite powerful and quite flexible. There are six or seven different settings that you can have in the sidebar that you can switch on and off. This issue or feature is now that, once you assign a poster image to the video the first time, it remembers it. When you embed it into a page or post again, because it&#8217;s in a different context or it&#8217;s in a series of videos or something like that, you don&#8217;t have to assign the poster image again, it will remember it. It&#8217;s all about the effort to streamline the content creator&#8217;s workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is also a change in the query pagination next and previous blocks. They are very low level blocks that construct the query pagination, which is part of Query Loop Block, but it shows how flexible the InnerBlocks paradigm is. There is now an arrow attribute that syncs next/previous block arrows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It was there before, but it wasn&#8217;t really good, visible in the sidebar or for people to check on. Now they are real settings that are big buttons that you can click so it changes. You were always able to change the text of your pagination from next to previous page or something else. You say low level, but it&#8217;s also quite an important block because, when you get to full-site editing and you write your own templates and you have a list of block posts from a category or from a tag and you have multiple pages of those, you want that query pagination to be available and also be usable. It&#8217;s quite interesting, especially for publishers that have online magazines or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There&#8217;s also a change in the post outer block. You&#8217;ve got duotone support. At first I was surprised seeing that, but there is an avatar or the image of the user which got this feature, which is, again, a good to have way to apply similar effects to all images on your page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, or just make it blend in more into the overall design because it&#8217;s a small avatar. To normalize it amongst all the others that you have on your site. There&#8217;s also, the wide alignment control now is only available if the theme provides the layout wide size setting. I think that&#8217;s a change to, so you can adjust that setting through the theme JSON again and not have to &#8230; yeah, you don&#8217;t have to do it through the functions PHP now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I think in the past you would enable full and wide at once, so it just gives you more grand control over those features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, you can now decide, okay, I only want the wide but not the full, or you only want the full but not the wide kind of thing. Yeah. That&#8217;s a good point. Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is also a quite important change for the navigation screen that&#8217;s being in the works and preparing for the final release. They are the undo and redo buttons in the editors, it&#8217;s the same feature that you have for the post content editor in the headers, it was just missing there. Definitely an important change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh yeah, yeah. All in the streaming of the content creator&#8217;s workflow. Streamlining, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s also related to the keyboard shortcuts. Some of you probably use command Z and command X. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The redo? I don&#8217;t know. I never redo, I only do undo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, command Z is the most popular one because you want to go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I need to find out what the keyboard….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, check this out in the Gutenberg editor when you go to the header and there is three dots, menu, then you have keyboard shortcuts as one of the options. That&#8217;s the simplest way to check all the shortcuts and learn new if you don&#8217;t know them yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. There were other changes to the navigation screen. I just wanted to remind our listeners that it&#8217;s not yet in the plug-in per se, it&#8217;s still in experimentation so you need to go to the Gutenberg menu and the WP admin experiments section and then check the navigation screen so you can test it for yourself and try and help us get it tested and do a lot of bug fixes, bug reports there. There is also a change, the REST API team is working on creating the end points for the navigation editor for the menu. At the moment I think it&#8217;s all through the admin Ajax. The final version will use the REST API like any other places in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, speaking of screens there&#8217;s a widget editor. It now received a widget group block for the widget screen which is quite nice now to follow the idea of classic widgets where you have a heading and then a widget. You can change the title of it and now you can add the heading and the widget into a group and then get it a little bit more contained and keep it together, style them and have a background of it and all that. It&#8217;s more what the user was accustomed to when dealing with widgets, the widget group helps with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I would say it&#8217;s more to bridge the experience for everyone familiar with the widgets old screen. It seems like a good change in that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I like it, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I don&#8217;t know how it works technically. When you insert a widget does it wrap it with the group out of the box now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think you can highlight, like you do in the post editor, you highlight the things that you want to group and then you transform it into a widget group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. The widget group has all the group block settings as well in the sidebar. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some enhancements for the global styles or fixes. Now you are able to disable text and background colors via the theme JSON. I thought you were doing that before, but maybe it didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. As far as I know it&#8217;s related to some mock-ups that were presented. The idea is that you would be able to disable almost all the color customizations one by one. Maybe that worked only for the link before. There&#8217;s a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. I think they changed a little bit the logic on how sub-components are shown in the color panel. Link color is enabled when the block supports it, the theme supports it, it&#8217;s launched by default. Yeah, it needs to be switched on or even the presets contain some solid value or the custom colors are used. Presets have some color. You need some color presets and the same is true for the text color, the background color and the gradients, although the gradients, you need to have either the custom colors in there or it&#8217;s empty, it&#8217;s disabled. For both the link color, text color and background color the block needs to support it, the theme needs to be supported and the defaults are different for each of them. Then the presets need to contain values for it. That&#8217;s quite a good set of logic there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, they streamlined all that logic and then now they are making the global styles available for all themes. That&#8217;s in PR 34334. I like that number, 34334. The preset classes for colors and font sizes were in the block library and they are now part of the global styles sheet that&#8217;s loaded later. That&#8217;s a change in the style sheets that are included by default. Then the preset classes look like the preset dev class. There are some changes. If you need to target those classes you might want to look at this again here. There is a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I just shared a link with you from André is who one of the lead developers on the global styles project. He explains how the experience of using WordPress presets looked before team JSON and how it&#8217;s changed, how it got simplified. That would be a good read in this context. Also in the same PR that we are talking about, this 34, 334, there is a dev note sketched already that will be published later in the release process of WordPress 5.9. It also just covers what you, Birgit, just said. It&#8217;s pretty complex, so I guess that&#8217;s something that you should process at the time of learning how to use those presets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Then the media placeholder experienced another change. For now you can create a URL, if you wanted to add an image through the URL of the image you only could use absolute links. It needed to start with HTTP because it was a URL input type on the placeholder and that has changed to a text input type in some verification. Also now you can actually use local URLs. If you know the URL of your image that you want to add to a gallery or to a post, you can now use local URLs and don&#8217;t have to put in the domains, which is actually good when you move the site or move the site to a different domain, or you have just an image that&#8217;s somewhere in a different place than on the WP content uploads directory. That&#8217;s definitely a good thing that&#8217;s ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I personally was surprised that when you are using an input HTML tag, when you set the tag to URL it expects the full URL. That was the original issue that caused….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Caused this change, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> &#8230; this change. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think it was only Firefox, but the browser developers are really tightening up the browsing experience. That was a part of their verification so you wouldn&#8217;t be able to add it to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is also a quite important change for team developers. Now there are default editor styles that are applied to teams without team JSON and without editor styles. Sounds complex, but it&#8217;s just something that is even considered for the minor WordPress edits like 5.8 to now. It just adds some basic styles to all sides just to ensure that the experience is better for the block editor in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. This plays well out of the box even if the theme editor, the theme developer has not updated a style sheet for the theme. I think that&#8217;s a good place for the adoption of the block editor that we are all working towards, that more and more people adopt that, especially in the themes. If it&#8217;s nice looking out of the box and they don&#8217;t have to go back to the theme developer to style a column or to style images or the widened and full width or the media and text, that there are quirks, I think that&#8217;s a good decision now that theme developers can control it through theme JSON and their own editor styles. They can just the default styles. Yeah, that&#8217;s good work there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>New APIs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, here it is. Of course, every time, and you hear me say this on this podcast quite a bit, every time you have a new feature you also need to provide the opt out of the feature. Here it is, allow themes with theme JSON to opt out of the block gap styles. There is a mechanism there how you do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s also related to the fact that it was opt in add styles, so now that&#8217;s probably, it has become a default so now you need to have a way to disable that if you don&#8217;t like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Now we moved also to the new API sections with this item on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah. Yeah. We have so many sections in this release note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes, it&#8217;s very long this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s very nice, yeah, but it&#8217;s also &#8230; it&#8217;s pretty much in the settings of your theme JSON. It&#8217;s settings, spacing, block gap, null. That&#8217;s how you opt out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Quite a common way for all those global style related features. That&#8217;s the only item in the new API. Now it&#8217;s time for bug fixes. As usual, the list is very long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> There seem to be not really big boo-boos that we have fixed. You find in the list under the block library fixes for the gallery block. I wanted to point out that those are referring to the gallery Refactor. This is the newly created gallery block. It&#8217;s still an experiment in the Gutenberg plug-in. If you want to do the navigation screen and test the new gallery block, you have to enable them also on the experiments screen of your Gutenberg plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> You can always test the new gallery block on the new navigation screen and that&#8217;s two things at once tested properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But don&#8217;t do this in production. It&#8217;s called experiment for a reason. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I mean for new websites I wouldn&#8217;t worry at all about enabling the new gallery factor block. I think the fact that it&#8217;s in experiment still is only because of backward compatibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I would not say only. It&#8217;s a big part. It&#8217;s a big part and it&#8217;s also part of the headaches that they have, but it&#8217;s also &#8230; if you want to switch it on and you need a list of test instructions, I&#8217;ll link in the show notes to the GitHub issue 29882, 29882, because there&#8217;s a list of 40 tests that you can do, everything that you can do with a gallery block, you should do. We are preparing, on the developer relations team we are preparing an official call for testing that would hopefully get more people involved. We will also reach out to the plug-in developers to make sure they know about the new plug-in, new gallery block and update their features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that the developer team has already tested the full plug-ins like CoBlocks and Jetpack blocks gallery blocks, but there are many, many more that need to be tested. If you have questions about that, feel free to DM me. Send me a direct message on WordPress Slack at BPH. Again, the test instructions that are right now out, that also the developers use, is the issue 29882, 29882. Of course we&#8217;ll link in the show notes. I just want to make sure that everybody knows this is coming and it&#8217;s cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the Refactor? We talked about it before, but we always have new listeners. The gallery block as it is now is just a feature parity with the old classic editor gallery block where you have a list of images and then they&#8217;re all pulled in, but you&#8217;re not able to do much with those images except for moving them. You&#8217;re not able to adopt styles that are only for one image. The new gallery block is now a collection of single image blocks with which come all the features that you can do from an image block like obviously duotone, be it applying styles, applying backgrounds, adding a different link to each image and all these nice features. It&#8217;s a much richer experience for editors and you have much more freedom for it. It needs quite a few testings. Because of that switch of the InnerBlocks the extensions will change as well. I tested it about two months ago and I found that the gallery plug-ins that I used were working fine, but I&#8217;m not using all of the gallery blocks. It might have changed because there was some development on that. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, definitely the best part here is that now it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you are changing a dual image not a standalone block or it&#8217;s part of the gallery block, you have everything unified, the same controls, the same capabilities. It&#8217;s pretty cool to see that working this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Also all the extensions that you have for the image block are now also in the gallery block which is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Cool is the right word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: Yeah. We are still on bug fixes. One of the changes that landed is for the writing flow, it&#8217;s in the block editor now. When you merge two blocks together the current position of the cursor is put in a better place than before. I don&#8217;t know what exactly was the issue, but it&#8217;s very annoying when you need to use arrows to move the cursor to the proper position when you change this type of modification, like when you have two paragraphs or similar text-related box.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Then we get to the experiments but we have been talking about experiments before. Now you are able to put in the navigation block the site title as well as the logo and that makes it much nicer to assemble a header for a site when you use full site editing with that. It&#8217;s now really easy to have a logo and the site title and then the menu all in one line. Try it out and see if that works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m looking forward to see how the gallery block will evolve because the same feature that you have now in the navigation block could work there as well. I can imagine that you could inject a site logo also inside the gallery because why not, that would be also in some ways &#8230; you could have some designs where that would work. In general, the idea of InnerBlocks, this is what we really want because it just opens so many possibilities for designs that weren&#8217;t possible before. You had to hard code that in HTML in your PHP files and now it&#8217;s at your site, you just need to move some blocks around, insert something and then it just aligns nicely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s a good point, because now you could have, a three by three grid of images at the center could actually be a poem or something like that that is not an image but a text. The InnerBlocks really open up quite a few more possibilities, especially on the gallery block. That&#8217;s why the Refactor is so important and also that&#8217;s why it takes a little longer to merge into the plug-in because there are some things that need to be changed for backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get, the social links now use the Flex layout. That means you can arrange the social links either vertically or horizontally I think and also have the block gap in between so you can have the distances also controlled. All kinds of different things are available now in the social links block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Those design tools are really powerful. I&#8217;m looking forward to having them all stable and released as part of WordPress 5.9. I hope it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We need testers. We need people who test things. The more bugs you find, the better the release will be in 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Now we are at the documentation. This section, do you see something that is a bigger one? There is a lot of typos that were fixed or some tooling that was improved like ESLint, something that is more in general for the Gutenberg project. Some improvements to bring the documentation up to date, like replacing, we select calls from WordPress data package to use, a react hook which is called useSelect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Good point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I guess there isn&#8217;t anything very important that we have to mention today. Again, there&#8217;s a code quality. This section, it&#8217;s very long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But that&#8217;s your favorite section, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I mean it depends what&#8217;s inside it. There are some changes to bring code up to date, similar to what I said about using most recent APIs that were developed and some errors which is &#8230; for those who don&#8217;t know there are some special validations for the code quality that helps us catch some bugs. Whenever they show up or the tools get updated and they are better at catching those bugs we try to fix this as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There&#8217;s a lot of refactoring that doesn&#8217;t have any impact on the user interface but helps for the longer, in terms of long term support for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Various</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, I get it. That brings us also to my favorite section, the various section. There&#8217;s one item in there that I wanted to point out, that&#8217;s the vertical heading levels menu. When you insert a heading into the block editor, you get a list of levels, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6. Now you can have, the heading can now be vertical. I think it&#8217;s by default vertical now instead of horizontal as it was before so it only covers a certain different amount of content when you have the toolbar right next to the block. It&#8217;s quite nice to look at that. You just go with the mouse pointer up and down instead of left and right. That was a bit ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I think initially in the first release it was also vertical, but then, at that point, there were only H2, H3 and H4 options in the menu so it was short and it was quite easy to &#8230; on the visual level it would look better, but then you had six options like right now and there was also text for each of them. It just was too much to see H1 and heading one, this is why those iterations were applied now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It also came from the query block, when you have other, not only the heading block but also the post title block or the archive title, then the context of that menu was a little bit different and you were covering up too much of that query block that you tried to template things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Right, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. That was the other part. The heading is now multi-usage so to speak and not just a mere heading block. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>Yeah. The last item is a very important one. I hope that&#8217;s not the case for our listeners, but if you are using WordPress 5.6 then the Gutenberg plug-in won&#8217;t be supported anymore in that version. You need to have at least WordPress 5.7 to be able to still use the Gutenberg plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> To use the newer version of the Gutenberg plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: In general we recommend using the latest one because that makes everything so much easier, but we also know that, when there&#8217;s a new major version, some sites cannot be immediately updated. We wait for one more major release, but in the future we consider that this period of time would be shorter, maybe two months, three months, something like that. It also depends on the major release cycles. Now this year we have only three major releases. The plan initially was to have four. That wouldn&#8217;t be that much of an issue. With three releases it&#8217;s just too much time when we have to support code that is no longer necessary in the plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. To make this specific, if you are on 5.6, only Gutenberg plug-in until 11.4 will work with your WordPress. You can use the plug-in but you won&#8217;t get the updates after, unless you upgrade to the next version, 5.7, in your WordPress. I don&#8217;t know if I made it clearer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t want to test that, but &#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well if you have any questions, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Encourage everyone to stay on the latest major version which is 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, 5.8.1, yes. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the Gutenberg 11.5 Changelog. It&#8217;s quite an interesting mix on that, but most of them are design tools and theme related and some of them are related to some blocks and also for the content creator flows. It&#8217;s a nice release again with a lot of people bringing &#8230; we have quite a few new contributors now on the Gutenberg repository which is a nice change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we are coming to the section of what&#8217;s in active development or discussed. Because it&#8217;s so &#8230; the next big thing that comes into WordPress is the navigation block and screen, or that&#8217;s what everybody&#8217;s hoping. Daniel Richards posted an update on what are they working on. Of course it&#8217;s slow progressing and they&#8217;re migrating the navigation editor, I mentioned it before, to the REST API. Those changes have been merged and it&#8217;s all updating now. Lots of UI changes that are working now, the top bar, the editor top bar being updated, the main block inserter added and then fixes for the block styles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I can put the important part, good discussion is on the way, he writes, on how to provide backwards compatibility for custom fields on existing menu screens. That covers the part where now the plug-in advance custom fields has a section where you can augment the menu, in the classic menu, with additional fields and additional information. The discussion on that issue is how far should that &#8230; the team works under the assumption that it needs to all be backwards compatible and it&#8217;s the issue &#8230; if you want to follow up and not go to the show notes, 31551 is the issue with the navigation screen menu items custom CF options. There&#8217;s a discussion, Elliot Condon, the lead developer on the plug-in, is in the discussion as well, so help make this, we need you to also chime in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what they&#8217;re working on next is that they want to have &#8230; in the current editor, menu editor you can say, &#8220;Okay, give me all the posts or all the pages.&#8221; You&#8217;re bulk adding links to your menu, that&#8217;s still in the works for the navigation screen, the block-based navigation screen and also to have theme JSON controls to configure the navigation block further. That still is in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It sounds like a lot of work to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Those all &#8230; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I&#8217;m sure all of those tasks are in progress, however to take them to the finish line is going to be quite a huge challenge because we have four weeks between go/no-go dates, so it really depends. Also I could envision that the new navigation block would be included in core but maybe not the navigation screen. There is a lot of ways to proceed in this regard. Let&#8217;s see how it works. I hope that the screen will be enabled. Opt in is the only option they consider, similar to the widget screen, that you need to enable yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. I think so, especially with the backwards compatibility. These menu plug-ins that are out there, it&#8217;s not only the advanced custom fields plug-in that modified the menu pieces or menu entity or the link entity in the menu screen or menus, there were other plug-ins, albeit the Mega Menus, albeit some others. They need to be backwards compatible. Oh, the other part was naming menus. When we build sites we sometimes have a footer menu, a header menu and a main menu and we need to name them and make them available to pull in into any other screens there and make them available for full-site editing as well. There are a few things that this powerful feature in classic WordPress, it&#8217;s hard to reproduce it and be as flexible as it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Okay. That&#8217;s all about the announcement. I just wanted to remind that I&#8217;m taking time off. Unfortunately that coincides with the next Gutenberg release. Together with Birgit we decided to skip recording in two weeks. We cover two Gutenberg plug-in releases in one episode and that should be available for you in four weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s right. We will take a break from the podcast. I hope you are subscribed to the newsletter of the Gutenberg Times so you can still get some updates in between, or just visit the website in between.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the end of the show I want to remind you that there is actually a live Q&amp;A coming up on October 7 at 16 UTC, 11 Eastern, when we discuss the building, going from building classic themes to building block based themes with Ellen Bauer, Carolina Nymark and Andres Norén. We will entertain you there and answer all your questions. I&#8217;m thinking I will ask them to actually stay for, instead of 60 minutes to 90 minutes, because we will have some demos and we want to make sure that we answer all your questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a link on the homepage of the Gutenberg Times and of course we will have it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">GutenbergTimes.com/podcast</a>. This is episode 52. If you have questions or suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com\">Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com</a>.

My handle is G-Z-I-O-L-O. You, Brigit, is B-P-H, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Right. Well I say thank you, Greg, Grzegorz, it was again a great pleasure talking to you. I wish you a wonderful vacation in Greece. Until the next time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Thank you, Birgit and our listeners for being with us.

In today&#8217;s episode we&#8217;ll talk about Automattic becoming a sponsor of Gutenberg Times and the Changelog, theme.json, Gutenberg 11.4 release and a lot more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator of the Gutenberg Times, and I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. Hi, Grzegorz, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I still feel energized and extremely excited after all the big news shared this Monday in the context of the Gutenberg project. Maybe you should speak first. How have you been lately? Has anything interesting happened?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s funny. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a wonderful week, though.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have fabulous news and some of our Gutenberg Times subscribers already know that. People who follow me on Twitter know this, but I&#8217;m thrilled to announce that on Monday, August 30th, I started as a developer advocate at Automattic. Grzegorz and I have been co-workers for five days now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yay! Congratulations. I can&#8217;t think of anyone else who fits better for this role.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, thank you. You&#8217;re too kind. Like many people who responded and shared on Twitter, many are podcast listeners, as I said, and I was overwhelmed by all the kindness in the WordPress community. Thank you to everyone. Sometimes Twitter really shares its love and I took it all in. Well, it was overwhelming, and a lot of people have reached out. And so thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Automattic is now main sponsor of the Gutenberg Times, the Changelog podcast, and our live Q&amp;As and my work working on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being part of the WordPress developer relations team feels like coming home to me. And I&#8217;m deeply grateful for Automattic for offering me that position. The best is yet to come for Gutenberg and publishing with blocks. I&#8217;m elated to be part of an astonishing team that takes the worldwide WordPress community to the next journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes, so I&#8217;m really glad that you will be able to dedicate 130% of your work time to help people to get to their next level when hacking with Gutenberg. And I&#8217;m highly impressed with what you were able to achieve as a volunteer, in addition to other duties that help you to pay the bills. So I can also imagine how much of an impact it will make on the community now. I said there is more news to share. What else has happened?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, on Monday, Frontity announced they joined Automattic too. So Grzegorz, can you describe what Frontity framework is, and how this fits into the Gutenberg roadmap?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So for those who don&#8217;t know Frontity, it&#8217;s a &#8230; how they call it? Server-side dynamic framework for headless WordPress sites and blocks. So in some ways, it&#8217;s similar to Gatsby for those who know the space of headless or decoupled WordPress. The biggest difference is that Gatsby, it&#8217;s a static site generator, which means it generates HTML files, JavaScript files, and it just runs on your server, so you don&#8217;t need Node.js server, whereas Frontity uses Node.js.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it allows you to create a sort of front-end theme that is for WordPress, and that&#8217;s run in Node.js. And it uses the content you create including the content with blocks, and it adds some additional functionality to it like nice page transitions. It adds some dynamic features like for images and there are plugins that can apply some changes to that so it&#8217;s really interesting. And the best thing here is that Frontity as a framework, in their announcement post, they said that they are planning to pivot their efforts to WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, but so Frontity runs in ReactJS too, right? Not only Node.js but ReactJS, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, that&#8217;s awesome. So Matias Ventura, he&#8217;s a member the developer experience team at Automattic and lead architect at the WordPress Gutenberg project. He wrote that, &#8220;I&#8217;m really impressed with the effort and care the Frontity team has put into the work over the past few years. We are at a cusp of exciting new opportunities for Gutenberg and I cannot wait to start collaborating together on making the experience of developing with it a joy to behold.&#8221; So that sounds like a great pivot for Frontity to just be a framework to actually bring everything into Gutenberg, as you said, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So I see it more like they bring their experience. And they will try to replicate some of great ideas they had in the Frontity framework, and find ways to achieve the same goals inside WordPress core, which would benefit so much bigger audience. I&#8217;m thinking about developers, but also for users on the WordPress. And I&#8217;m also beyond excited about the plan they outlined in the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they said that, &#8220;Automattic offered to sponsor our team to work directly on the WordPress open-source project, and in particular, to contribute our expertise in developer experience, front-end tooling, performance and user experience to the WordPress core itself.&#8221; So this is exactly what I just said. And actually for me, who is focused around experience with building blocks, it&#8217;s really great how this expertise can bring the project to the next level, and our efforts to making full-site editing so performant and optimized for bringing only the assets you need, bringing what&#8217;s missing the most now is that the block editors is focused on the WP Admin but on the front-end side, we need more interactivity and more better experience of global sites, the first step but Frontity bringing their own experience can fill the gaps in other areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. And I have seen that there are also developer relations people with Frontity, so I&#8217;m glad we will definitely be able to learn from them. What I missed early on was talking about the developer relations team. It&#8217;s actually now a band of five with Anne McCarthy and Daisy Olsen being there for almost over a year just wrangling the whole thing by themselves. And then Tara King was joined, and then Ryan Welcher and myself, so we are band of five.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there are two people coming away from Frontity, but I&#8217;m not quite sure yet. We haven&#8217;t even as a team yet have &#8230; because we&#8217;re all new. So we&#8217;re all in support rotation right now at Automattic and at the WordPress forums. So I think next week is going to be the bigger week where we&#8217;ll co-organize everything a bit better. Yeah, so but there&#8217;s exciting news for the future of Gutenberg and there&#8217;s also some good news for some other site owners, agencies and developers. The WordPress core committers officially extended the support for the Classic Editor plugin all through 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives everyone another year to migrate to blocks. Josepha Haden Chomphosy wrote, &#8220;Still, if you have been putting off using the Block Editor, this is an excellent time to give it another shot. Since it first appeared in 2018, hundreds of WordPress contributors have made a lot of updates based on user feedback. And you will be pleasantly surprised how far it&#8217;s come.&#8221; Of course, most of our listeners know that, about all the huge changes because we haven&#8217;t been shutting up about them. But it&#8217;s definitely an interesting year now for the Gutenberg project and migrating to Gutenberg because all of a sudden, it has a much better picture of the final version or the final vision. Not the version, it will never be done, but yeah, final vision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, now that quite a few APIs are settled, there is a great creativity amongst developers and we&#8217;re going to talk about it a little later in the show. But on the WordPress Tavern, Justin Tadlock also interviewed core committer, Jonathan Desrosiers. And he had some more details on their approach towards maintaining the plugin beyond 2022. So we will share that link in the show notes like we will all the other links in our Announcement section here, that&#8217;s now quite big. Yes. Anything to comment there, Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I mean I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there were listeners of this podcast that still use the Classic Block plugin. And this is mostly because you might have a site that is no longer developed and it just doesn&#8217;t make too much sense take therefore to migrate that to blocks. So there are always use cases like that. So I&#8217;m really happy that the support is extended. But eventually, I think that it would be good to say that it&#8217;s only a plugin. And if you want to, just keep it installed, and the community should take over the effort, because it&#8217;s a lot of work to keep it up to date. And it&#8217;s not something that we want to have forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, and funny, you mentioned that. I have quite a few sites, and it might surprise everybody to hear that, quite a few sites that are actually on Classic Editor. We have taken them over about two years ago or some of them three years ago. And the theme is that Franken theme, like where all the plugin functionalities within the theme. And then there are plugin that we could build and separate out. But the theme, it does the custom post types, and then relies heavily on advanced custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even they have a blocks kind of building thing, there is no migration work done between former advanced custom field sites to migrating to blocks. That&#8217;s one thing. I own this one site where there are thousands and thousands of posts on them that there&#8217;s no bulk, reliable way to migrate those over. One site is so old, or that was designed in 2012. So it&#8217;s not even responsive now, or the responsiveness is kind of really clunky, but the content creator has used a lot of HTML tags within his postings. And it&#8217;s an elaborate layout. Making that into Gutenberg blocks is very, very, very hard. But those are the projects I will be handling sooner or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, there is a good reason to stay in Classic Editor for another year or two or three. But yeah, you&#8217;re right. Once in a while, it&#8217;s probably needs to be taken over by the community. And there are actually a few plugins already in the repository that go a little bit further than the Classic Editor. One of them is by John Starr, and it says Disable Gutenberg. And it also covers the classic widgets section from that. So yeah, just a little side note, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> One question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So why don&#8217;t you stop upgrading WordPress, like keep it on 4.9 and just take the security updates? Isn&#8217;t that the best option to feel safe about the future of the site?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, I think sooner or later that most people would actually appreciate Gutenberg as a user interface and getting block patterns rather than a section of, I don&#8217;t know, two pages of ACF Meta Boxes and they don&#8217;t have a clue how it looks, as long as they don&#8217;t hit preview and see how it looks on the front-end. And so, I think the advantages of using Gutenberg for even a big site that has a lot of layouts would be even better. So a migration sooner or later needs to happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, not only for that, but also we have new editors come online, all the knowledge is kind of outdated, or they see it on other sites. And that&#8217;s a WordPress skill now, to work with Gutenberg. And now they come to a publication that doesn&#8217;t use them, it&#8217;s anachronistic. It takes the fun out of it, pretty much. It takes the fun out of me when I need to use the Classic Editor because, &#8220;Oh, it would be so much easier to do it in Gutenberg and we can do so many more things.&#8221; So sooner or later, we need to think about migrating these large sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So I guess the reason is that you want to stay with the latest WordPress to get all the updates and make sure that the plugins are still compatible, and they also get updates, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I mean, it makes a lot of sense. I&#8217;m just mostly curious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, I totally get it. Yeah. Especially that-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I guess we can move on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; I think we have to otherwise we&#8217;re getting a little long, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We can move on to Community Contribution. So I only wanted to highlight two full-site editing themes that I found out about recently. One of them is called Frost and the other one is Aino, I don&#8217;t know if I pronounced that right. And they are very interesting. And we&#8217;ll leave the links in the show notes as usual. And one of those themes had a very interesting idea because it was like a master theme that had a collection of block patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like you have many different target groups in one theme, but you can select that through pattern, which is pretty interesting idea. It&#8217;s like a sort of block patterns directory inside the theme, which is something new. I like those explorations in the community that happen right now with all the new possibilities. So Aino is also targeting e-commerce websites. So that&#8217;s also quite fine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So Aino has been built by Ellen Bauer and Manuel Esposito, I think, the theme developer shop out of New Zealand. And Ellen Bauer was already part of our live Q&amp;As talking about full-site editing early on. And Frost WP is the full name of the site, frostwp.com, started by Brian Gardner. And Brian Gardner has been around the WordPress community for ages. He was the original founder of the Genesis framework, which was then sold to WP Engine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has started now, with the full-site editing in mind, a new theme base called Frost WP. So both themes are not done by new people. They evolve their own coming from the Classic theme going into full-site editing theme and going in full speed. So it&#8217;s really exciting to see them grow and work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, pretty inspiring to see those full-site editing themes growing. And I also wanted to report that I did my homework, and I caught up with the new Tell Me About Blocks podcast, which is hosted by Michael Schneider. I guess he&#8217;s from Germany, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think Australia, but I haven&#8217;t done my homework yet. I haven&#8217;t connected with him yet, which will happen. Michael, if you listen to this, expect a ping from me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, so if you look for inspiration how to build blocks, or extend their capabilities inside the WordPress Block Editor, then I strongly recommend listening to both published episodes. I enjoyed the one with Rich Tabor a bit more because he has outstanding experience in the field and he profoundly understand the project&#8217;s visions. So I wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable saying that he&#8217;s a representative of the Gutenberg core team and put him on the spot and talk about Gutenberg. He deeply understands how it all should work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and I followed Rich Tabor from the beginning of his CoBlocks plugin that came out quite early. He built it with Jeffrey Carandang together. Listened to him at the Boston WordCamp in 2019. And he had some great philosophical ideas on how to build blocks in terms of what needs to be in the toolbar, what goes into the sidebar, and how to approach metadata and options data that need to be built into the Block Editor as well and how to handle those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was quite an interesting way. So he publishes also on richtabor.com, with blog starts about theme.json, about his experience, and what he thinks how everything should work and how it works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 5.8.1 RC</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this brings us to our What&#8217;s Released section, and we have a release candidate for WordPress 5.8.1. And it was released two days ago on September 1st, and it has 41 bug fixes to core and about 20 bug fixes to the Block Editor. Although there are 20 release pull requests as you mentioned before we started recording, Grzegorz, not all of them are part of the bug fix. Some of them are just PRs that need to be added so the other PRs would work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, so Gutenberg developed so fast that we introduce some technical changes that just are related to, let&#8217;s say, code quality, and then it makes it difficult to backport the actual bug fixes. So that&#8217;s why it took 20 commits, instead of let&#8217;s say, 10 or 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So we will share the show notes to the release candidate post on the core Make blog with all the track tickets and PRs that went into it. The release date for it is September 8th, unless, of course, any additional fixes to be made. But that&#8217;s expected to be Wednesday, September 8.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 11.4 Release</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we had Gutenberg 11.4 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Finally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Finally?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Finally, the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, do you want to start out with what the most important things are?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It&#8217;s one thing that I marked like we said and big font is the change that converts the Gallery block to use Image block. So it&#8217;s a concept of having composed log of several blocks, I mean, two blocks at the moment. So this change is still behind an experimental flag. So you need to go in the WP Admin to the sidebar. And there is Gutenberg, and there is Experiments page, and you need to mark the checkbox and save the settings to enable this new version of the block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons that were covered with the dev note that we talked about, I guess in the last episode. We will include the link to the dev note. This change is planned for inclusion in WordPress 5.9. So we encourage all the block authors and theme authors to check out this new version, because there will be some incompatibilities. It&#8217;s mostly because the markup has changed, and it might break some CSS styles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also some plugins that do transforms between Gallery blocks to something else or vice versa. So that needs a lot of testing, it was tested extensively already, because it&#8217;s a huge change, which brings a lot of opportunities. And the best way to check it out is look at the release post for the Gutenberg plugin, which shows that demo, and it&#8217;s really nice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It shows how you can move images, you can change every individual image the same way as you modify a single image. So, that&#8217;s a great way. You can use drag and drop now inside the Gallery block. It&#8217;s just an excellent change. And of course, the plugin authors can do any change they wanted. Usually they can allow you to use other blocks inside the Gallery block, it&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s totally &#8230; I love to see&#8230;. I have experimented with it a bit. And yeah, I like that you can have a different style for each image. So you can have rounded corners for one and circles for a speaker list or something like that. Or each image can have a separate URL now. So when you do a speaker section, that each speaker gets its own link to the profile or the session; just thinking about online conferencing right now, I guess. But it&#8217;s really exciting to see how that works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually tested this PR a couple of months ago. And I was really amazed how it worked quite well with some of the plugins that you mentioned, Grzegorz like CoBlocks Gallery, or others that had a gallery modification. The three ones that I worked with, were quite compatible with it. I know that Glen Davies, who spearheaded the refactor of the Gallery block also did additional testing with that. He tested them with the Jetpack blocks and Lightbox for the Default Gallery &amp; Image Block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I mean, he also made a point in testing the three default themes, as well as Astra and Arbutus. So it&#8217;s all in the developer note that he published and which you will find a link in the show notes as Grzegorz said. Yeah, but I&#8217;m really excited about this. I think this is such a great way to put a huge photo gallery together and make it work on a website, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, and just to add more, so now in the Gallery, you can apply image editing, so you can crop the individual image. You can add duotone effects. It&#8217;s so powerful because of this change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And all you learn with the Image block, you can certainly apply to the Gallery block now. And you don&#8217;t have to use two different ways on image handling. So that&#8217;s definitely an advantage of reducing the cognitive load and expand the horizon a bit. Yeah. So what else is in there? Good. All the next things seem to be like an anticlimax to that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Cover block now; you can allow an alt text now for your Cover blocks, which is a great accessibility necessity. The Block Lists is now improved, the iframe block, patterns and template previews. So it&#8217;s easier to see what you&#8217;re getting when you go through the list. What else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There are a couple of changes to Post Featured Image. So it was pretty basic before but now there is support for duotone. They added the scale property, so which allows you to change how this Post Featured Image is displayed inside the block. And as far as this Post Featured Image can fit to the space it has, it can be somehow like constraint and something like that. So there is some contextual help now added to make it clear what it does, really. And there is now, for other blocks, there is font weight support that was added to several blocks, like Post Date, Post Terms, Site Tagline, and the Button. And yeah, basically, it&#8217;s a constant effort to add those features to more blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, to add more controls to more blocks. Yeah. So I think what I learned with Gutenberg was that well, first, one block gets an extension like the font weight controls, and then once that is finalized, it will be replicated for the other blocks, or other blocks get the support for that, and then it&#8217;s tested, how that would work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I really like that to kind of have additional testing in there before it&#8217;s rolled out to all the blocks. Yeah, and that way, the Button block received the spacing support that uses axial padding. So you can have also horizontal and vertical padding for the buttons now within your Buttons block, which is a feature that was requested quite a bit for Gutenberg. And because many, many block suites actually had that built in almost from the beginning, but so now it&#8217;s in core. Yay!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So this is&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, mark, also some changes, because we have those editor feature preferences. And they were reimplemented now on the Widgets page, on the Site Editor page, on the Post Editor page and now they are extracted. And the idea is to have one common interface to use on all screens and share the logic. So that needs to be tested by all the users because there might be some bugs. I would expect that because there is some technical challenges in how to migrate that and store it in the browser. So when whenever you refresh the page, you have still the same settings, they are stored in the local storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> When you talk about feature preferences, do you have an example of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, sure. So when you open the more menu like the one on the top, on the right side, and then you have fix my toolbar to the top, disable the full screen mode, and things like that, so some of them are present on all screens, some of them are specific to the given screen, but the code that powers that is now in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. So for all the three editors, it&#8217;s all at one place. And if you change it for one, you know where to change things? Is that answer the past or it&#8217;s now getting closer to thinking about taking those preferences out of local storage and put it into user metadata or is that still a ways off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Oh, this one is actually in progress for two years or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right, right. But I can understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So we are aware about this limitation. So the first exploration was to use cookies. And because there is some API already that uses cookies in WordPress. However, cookies have limitations in the browsers. In some of them it&#8217;s four kilobytes and in turns out that it&#8217;s not enough for the settings that we want to store. So yeah, there is a REST API-based approach that is close to land, but it never happened. And definitely….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; No, I can see why. Yeah, I can see why it didn&#8217;t happen. Because the editors&#8217; screens were not yet finalized. Because many people knew that there will be a Widget screen, there will be a Navigation screen and then there will be a said editor screen. And the other preference were not yet settled completely over all for different editors. So I can see why it didn&#8217;t happen. But it was also not kind of clear to me that that&#8217;s the reason. Yeah because-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> &#8230; It&#8217;s also complex from the user perspective because now it&#8217;s the question. So now, you said that you don&#8217;t want to have full screen mode. The question is, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to have it only on one of the screens or it should be applied to all screens?&#8221; And now we have it in one place, we could consolidate that and give this option that this option should apply to all screens. But that would now like these user-experience questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s also other questions. So once you pick something; now I am on the mobile that have a small screen. Do I want to have fullscreen there, or it should apply only to the desktop? So there are so many combinations that make it really hard to build a good API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; Yeah. I imagine. And there&#8217;s also the question, &#8220;Okay, if we do it for our editor team, but when I&#8217;m an administrator, do I want to change that setting again?&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s another level there. So I can see why that hasn&#8217;t been finalized. But then if you really want to have your editor screen, I don&#8217;t know what Marias Jensen does, he has this plugin where he stores these kinds of preferences, actually, in the user database, how he manages that. So it&#8217;s interesting to see, yeah once that&#8217;s explored, where it goes. But for this release, all things are now in one interface package. So that&#8217;s a big start in that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but the changes are applied per screen. So when you change the&#8230; what is it, your toolbar displayed, it will only apply to the given screen for now. But in the future, it has to be decided and we are looking for feedback. So new listeners, if you want to chime in, just open an issue and propose how you would like to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I like that. This brings us to the Bug Fix section, and there were quite a few small bug fixes. We are pointing today to the design tools section, which fixes a bug that now allows zero values for those theme.json styles. So the theme.json style generation. So, a quick side note. I had a conversation with a Jason Crist, who is on the theme team at Automattic and he said we need to make a more a &#8230; he didn&#8217;t say we need but I learned that it might be helpful to say, JSON, when you mean the JSON file, and Jason when you mean the person named Jason. It&#8217;s really hard to do this, or you change your name to JSON, like Jason Bahl did, the WPGraphQL plugin developer. Anyway, so what&#8217;s up with zero values in the theme.json styles?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So global styles it&#8217;s like a new specification of CSS written in JSON. And you know that the issue was that it was possible to write the string 0px, like pixel, but when you were providing a number or the string with zero, it would filter it out because JavaScript or PHP would consider it empty. And so, they fixed that and those values are also allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So like I could open that I don&#8217;t want any gradients by adding the gradient but leave the array empty and it would actually disable gradient?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Maybe, I don&#8217;t know about that basically. But for the field or property, it was quite important. To have padding equal zero is quite common if you don&#8217;t want to provide the unit all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Mm-hmm. Excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us to the Performance section of the changelog, and there is one that now provides a batch function to the data module to batch actions. I recognize the words, but what does that mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a new API in the WordPress data package that allows you to combine several actions, which means changes to the state of the application. So that prevents that on every change, you would have re-render of your UI. So it just waits until other actions get applied and then sends the signal, &#8220;Okay, components, you can check out for changes now.&#8221; So instead of having several renders that most of them would be wasteful, it just waits for the better time for do it. And it&#8217;s pretty common technique that I&#8217;m surprised we didn&#8217;t have it before. And all agreed about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. And does it add to performance gains?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, on the PR did. However, when I looked at that post and the metrics chart, at the bottom of it, I didn&#8217;t see any differences. So it&#8217;s really hard to see impact of one PR, because there are other that could downgrade the performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Good, excellent, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In theory, it should make a difference when applied on a larger scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right, now you&#8217;re going to take us into the Experiments?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I can talk about some of the experiments because I developed two of them, I guess. And so one change that we are looking into is when you have these blocks, like Gallery is now a good example. When you turn on the experiment, you have Gallery block and an Image blocks. Sometimes, you go to the Image block, and you just want to apply something to all blocks like let&#8217;s say, there&#8217;s some alignment option in the Gallery block you want to take the space of the full canvas, or the&#8230; how it&#8217;s called, a full and wide, or like regular. So it&#8217;s like going back and forth between parent and child block, it&#8217;s pretty annoying.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that you could do two things. One is dock the toolbar that it always is anchored to the parent block. The toolbar is always displayed in the place when you have the Gallery block. When you enable this option, then the alignment would be also actually shared with the child block. From the child block, you could change the alignment or alter the Gallery block. And yeah, this is something for the toolbar control that is already in place. It&#8217;s still experimental. We are looking also and adding the same functionality to the inspector control, so all the controls that are in the sidebar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, there were also new refactoring to bring their groups. So that is also interesting from the plugin author&#8217;s perspective because if you have more structured way, then first you will be able to target those groups to insert your controls. At the moment, you can either add it to the general sections like next to all other controls or to the advanced one, which is pretty limiting. And in the future, we think that there will be a lot of groups that have more structured way of handling those controls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One exploration is to add dimensions control so I can see a follow-up with the typography or colors. It&#8217;s a better way to have these controls distributed and the user experience also would be better because you could easily remember where to find something. And that also brings another possibilities like very frequent requests from the site owners to disable some of the controls, and we don&#8217;t have controls over third-party changes. So you could at least disable the group now, and that would be a great way. And usually, that&#8217;s what you want instead of doing granularly, just tell that this group shouldn&#8217;t be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, it&#8217;s really helpful to have the single block also be part of the parent block toolbar to control those properties over all their child blocks, that&#8217;s really great. The next part was the blocks spacing. Now the global styles also have a block spacing gap configuration that you can control through the theme.json file. And it also adds support for the layout to control the gap between blocks. Tested out, global styles are still in the experiments as well. So you need to switch them on. But it&#8217;s getting really interesting now that global styles is prepared for 5.9. It&#8217;s not clear that it will be in 5.9. But we want to definitely test all those things for the user controls, and especially also to switch off user control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the Documentation. There were mostly minor changes to the handbook, but one item got me excited that says, &#8220;Alphabetize the glossary entries.&#8221; Especially from a higher-level point well, there is a glossary. I looked at the PR and it&#8217;s actually the glossary on the core contributor&#8217;s handbook that has been alphabetized. So if you ever want to know what a committer is or what CRUD means or what a dev note is, the glossary, and I will put the link into the show notes, so you don&#8217;t have to dig it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you can look it up there. It&#8217;s quite extensive, and I really like it. Now it&#8217;s alphabetized, so you might as well find stuff. Of course, for the alphabetization to work, you actually need to know what the name of the thing is that you look up. So it might be worth reading through the glossary from A to Z is probably a good way to expand on that. Yeah, anything else in that part that you want to point out?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> No, no, in fact, in the Code Quality section, that is next, there are eight items. But those are also some minor changes that I didn&#8217;t find anything to highlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right, that brings us to the Tools section. And there are quite a few PRs that have the same beginning, and that is, &#8220;Automated Changelog&#8221; and I&#8217;m really happy about that, because we go through the changelog, and if it&#8217;s well organized and structured, Grzegorz and I, we can really work through this quite easily. So you have been working with people there as well or was it somebody &#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, that was quite a nice team like Dave Smith, Hector Pietro, myself, and Dan Richards. So yeah, we teamed up and everyone contributing in some way. So now the changelog you see in the release post, and also in the show notes we share, it&#8217;s mostly automated. So that&#8217;s very exciting that you can see everything in this form now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Yeah. And then there were some changes on the GitHub contributor template, that the form to fill out an issue has been simplified for the bug report with a form template, so you can lead along and don&#8217;t miss any information. So it short-circuits the communication line. Once you report it, developers don&#8217;t have to come back and ask you for additional information. So filling that out is really helpful and speeds up the process. And you don&#8217;t forget anything when you fill out the bug report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s a nice change from GitHub, that they provided a way to make this process more like filling a form. So it&#8217;s much simpler from the user perspective because they know what they have to provide rather than skipping the previous version, and everyone just ignore most of the points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; Yeah, yeah. And it&#8217;s easier, you don&#8217;t have to remove stuff from the issue template to get it all fixed up. Yeah. No, really good work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, there&#8217;s one more change that I personally find very interesting. So whenever you have a block is parsed, then if the contents saved in the database no longer matches how the block should be represented in the post, there are some deprecation logs in the browser&#8217;s console. Most of the users they don&#8217;t see, but it&#8217;s important for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was after we introduced block patterns that they don&#8217;t get updated after they&#8217;re created, usually. So those logs started to pollute those browser consoles. So now, they are grouped together. Especially, it&#8217;s important when everything went well, so you don&#8217;t really have to report that however we do that for the information of the developers, maybe they want to update that. That&#8217;s a good reminder, but….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. I can see that the block patterns of course, changed all the time, even in the content and going back to the block patterns, not the same original. But I think that whole process is also a major pain point for developers to get into block development using JavaScript. The deprecation process per se, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s unstable or it&#8217;s just very verbose and laborious. I know quite a few developers have decided to just use PHP for the rendering, and not go through JavaScript for the render, and create dynamic blocks, quasi-dynamic-static blocks, so to speak. And looking is going to be helpful, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In this context, when you are using Cover blocks, and they get new features, and because of that, it requires new HTML markup to represent that, because you have those deprecations encoded, whenever someone inserts the button that was created two years ago, when you insert that into your post, you would get the most up to date version of that block, which is what we want to achieve and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important. Of course, when you are working on a site that you have different needs, then dynamic blocks is probably something that you want to have, however, in the context of using patterns, that has some downside when it&#8217;s dynamic because you just need to have something that you&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah, definitely. So there&#8217;s also one, well, pain point with that to just kind of surface it a bit more is when you have a changed block, the deprecations does not kind of go back to the block that was used two months ago and had a different HTML, it just does not recognize as a mistake, but it does not update the block, or the render or the content that was built with the block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s was also something that it&#8217;s hard for a developer to&#8230; or it was hard for me to figure out, &#8220;Okay, I built this block. And now I make an update and a new version of it. But all the previous usages of the blocks are not getting updated.&#8221; And that&#8217;s how you do when you have server-side rendering, it always uses the latest codebase for that. So, that was an interesting problem that surfaced with the JavaScript blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I know we deal with those issues all the time when we update the markup. It&#8217;s just the most painful&#8230; Also, for a core developer, believe me, it&#8217;s not simple, but the benefits which I covered are more important in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Okay, so what&#8217;s next on our changelog? That&#8217;s it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s kind of related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, no. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. So in this section, What&#8217;s in Active Development or Discussed, we have a very interesting debate on the internet. It&#8217;s still related to building blocks, but from the different angle than we covered in previous episodes. So it all started with the tweet from Mark Jaquith. And so, he poses the idea, as he explained, &#8220;What if building custom blocks for the Block Editor was as easy as supplying attributes and a block of HTML? What if this produced React-editing code and PHP-rendering code without a build step?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s just magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Magic. There was also a code snippet shared which was like a PHP class that had those attributes and a function that renders the aforementioned HTML. It&#8217;s a pretty nice idea. That&#8217;s funny because Riad was almost at the same time working on a prototype of something similar. And he shared his explorations on GitHub in the new repository he created there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea is almost the same. But instead of it using PHP, Riad asked, &#8220;Well, what if you use something that&#8217;s platform agnostic in a way that it doesn&#8217;t bound to a certain programming language, but something that we could use in PHP in JavaScript, but also in React Native or in any other languages you want?&#8221; So I really like how this discussion has developed. I also talked to Riad about his idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He walked me through, and it&#8217;s really interesting what he does is he just implements what Mark said. So he uses a JSON file. And in this JSON file, he also represents HTML, something sort of like HTML code, that then gets converted with the tool that he created into PHP, JavaScript and CSS that&#8217;s just represent your block. Yeah, a bit mind-blowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, he calls it Blocky, and we&#8217;ll share certainly the link in the show notes that&#8217;s on GitHub, for youknowriad&#8217;s user base kind of forward slash blocky. It&#8217;s not an automatic thing or something or a WordPress thing. But yeah. And then there was another discussion. I think there was this discussion was between Mark and Helen Hou-Sandi as well. Yeah. And what does she tried to do? She blogged about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, the idea was just to start discussion and set a good tone. I think that she shared also an example using Mustache-style tokens, which is something well known. It&#8217;s used in other projects like WP-CLI but also in Gutenberg in create-block tool. Yeah, but she does make the clear that it&#8217;s not about this particular templating system or the way it should be done. It&#8217;s more general. It&#8217;s like an example to better visualize the ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yes, I like the discussion, where it&#8217;s going, and the ideas that pop up. And there was also a comment from Lars Gersmann. And he said, &#8220;What if you would use pure ES6 template strings for rendering the components?&#8221; So it&#8217;s like just another way of represent. And this one is pretty interesting because people don&#8217;t like JSX when building blocks, which is a sort of another templating system to represent a code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in this context, there is something built by Jason Miller from Google. And it&#8217;s called HTM, and which basically, is something that some people use instead of JSX, which doesn&#8217;t require build step. So having this representation, of course, in PHP it doesn&#8217;t look so promising in that context. However, if you would have this templating system and a way to integrate that with PHP, you could do really interesting things. Like in JavaScript, you wouldn&#8217;t need a build step, you would just write this string as something that resembles HTML and it magically would convert to React components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m glad that now those conversations happen. But I think it also needed to have much advanced &#8230; you couldn&#8217;t have that conversation three years ago because you wouldn&#8217;t have the APIs in place to even do a proof of concept or kind of push it a little bit further. And so, it&#8217;s clear that that needs to have mature APIs and additional experience to push this a little bit further and make it more open for different variations to build blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pascal Bichler also chimed in. And he had this additional approach to saying, &#8220;Okay, using React components in the editor, but use web components that use the same API to render the front-end.&#8221; So it sounds like duplication, but on the other hand, web components are maintained by a large standard body and are not dependent on the implementation of the framework, like the React framework, or you can use web component with other frameworks as well. So if you would change the &#8230; God forbid, the editor to a different component system, you still could use the same front-end. That&#8217;s kind of interesting way to &#8230; that&#8217;s a larger look at things, way larger than I&#8217;m capable of, but yeah, it&#8217;s just another way to organize things there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, it aligns with what Mark proposed, to have one our presentation don&#8217;t get like, it behaves differently in the editor, differently on the front-end. But maybe it could be different if you are in a native app, on your phone, it would could have a different representation. It&#8217;s very interesting times to be in and engaged in those type of conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, for some who do day-to-day development, it seems to be more an academic discussion. But I think it would be really helpful to read Helen Hou-Sandi&#8217;s blog post, and of course, we&#8217;re going to share it. And she made a big point of saying this discussion is not between two WordPress core committers, like Mark Jaquith is and she is. She has been a lead developer for quite a while on the open-source project. This is just a discussion on programmers who do agency work to organize how they do custom blocks within the team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that certainly, should be interested to some of the agencies that also work with us and have been on the fence of using Gutenberg or have tried to solve some of the problems and to get additional input from those that Helen Hou-Sandi works for 10up and Mark Jaquith is, I think, a freelance developer. So from their point of view, it&#8217;s definitely worth a read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. If I look through our notes here, I have just one thing that I wanted to point out that is Matias Ventura, who is called the spark of Gutenberg in one of the publications, posted a short blog post, but it&#8217;s giving the theme.json file its horizon, pretty much. And he covers there when themes are going full-site editing, or using the theme.json file for controlling all the different places of the theme, it has some consequences on interactivity because you now can build an interface on top of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On consolidation, you can remove the overhead of repetitive declarations about block features, and then compatibility, that language of blocks is by default compatible with third-party blocks, which I find is a quite compelling argument to switch over to theme.json because the plugins then also can connect with the theme and be more&#8230;. We talked about it, Grzegorz before here, that if you have an additional custom post type or a different content that you want to put on the front-end, you can tap into the theme.json to style i, or keep it in style with the local theme without having to do a lot of your own CSS put to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It definitely has a performance gain on rendering those block themes and starting to roll out them. And it has a flexibility component to it, a visual parity. Talking about patterns, he talks about portability, accessibility, and also the admin section. So it&#8217;s quite an interesting post to look at from a bird&#8217;s eye view on the theme.json and what it will mean for WordPress and WordPress development. So that&#8217;s my before you go, end of the show thing. Do you have anything that you want to point out, Grzegorz?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No, I just wanted to emphasize the portability that we also discussed in the context of blocks, it&#8217;s just the same. How much this would change the landscape that you could have this meta language that allows you to write blocks that can be run in so many different places, not only inside the WordPress web app, but also on mobile devices, and in so many other places like in Drupal or whatever the future will bring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so I was wrong. I have two more things that are I wanted to just point out before we end the show. First&#8230; Oh, it&#8217;s actually three, no five&#8230; I never stop. Okay, so let&#8217;s wiggle that down. It&#8217;s Anne McCarthy has published the summary of the testing call for the header and the navigation block. It&#8217;s very interesting, the summary will be shared, but it also points out some of the pain points that still need to be resolved with navigation block and the screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then speaking of theme.json and portability, she is preparing with a team, also the next call for testing, which is not so much a testing of features, but a testing of a broader picture. And that is how themes switching will work or was supposed to work or what&#8217;s expectations about it? Because that&#8217;s certainly something would be relevant when we go into 5.9, or when it&#8217;s released, could be 6.0. But how does theme switching change now with theme.json and full-site editing? Meaning which of the templates that I as a user build, I want to keep when I switch the theme? Or is there a header that I want to keep when I switch the same kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how that&#8217;s supposed to work and that will be really great if you&#8217;ll have a lookout, we probably will talk about it at the next show. And then this third one, what I wanted to do is&#8230; And I totally forgot about it. So this is the end of the show. Yeah, no, it doesn&#8217;t come to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you so much, Grzegorz. It was a great show again, and we got some very interesting technical insights in how to approach some of the harder work at developing Gutenberg. So I think that was really helpful for me, especially, I learned a lot today. And then as always&#8230; Sorry, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s always good to discuss those difficult topics, but it&#8217;s very inspiring, also to see how the community explores all those ideas, so I&#8217;m glad to follow all those discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So as always, the show notes, and they will be quite long, will be published on the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">gutenbergtimes.com/podcast</a>. This is episode 51 and if you have questions and suggestions on any of it, please send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

Today, we will talk about the preliminary roadmap for WordPress 5.9, the Gutenberg 11.3 release, and the navigation screen and block, and so many more things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times, and I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziolkowski, code wrangler at Automatic and WordPress co-contributor. Good morning, Grzegorz. How are you? Thank you for agreeing to record this early and accommodate my in-laws&#8217; schedule. It&#8217;s fabulous weather for a bicycle tour tomorrow. So we&#8217;re doing it today. How are you?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Hello, Birgit. I&#8217;m great. It&#8217;s Wednesday, and we are before the official release of the Gutenberg plugin, but it looks like everything is ready. We are recording anyway. So the weather here is similar. It&#8217;s maybe not for bicycles for me, but there&#8217;s a lot of activities outside. I hope to play basketball in the evening with my friends. So that&#8217;s great, as always.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Physical exhaustion in the heat. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In fact, the weather is great, because it&#8217;s hot during the day, but the mornings and evenings, they are quite chilly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, that&#8217;s awesome. Yeah. Good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So first, we have some, I mentioned it, Matias Ventura published a preliminary roadmap for WordPress 5.9. Now, that 5.8 is out with some of the full-site editing in there, some block designs, block patterns, he has some thoughts on what needs to happen for the next release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His post divides up the work in six sections. We&#8217;re just going touch briefly on it, but do chime in Grzegorz anytime. So the first thing he mentioned is blocks and intrinsic web design, that he feels that the responsive tool, and of course not only he feels that, every theme developer feels that, that the responsive tools are still missing for blocks. And that needs to be addressed in regards to intrinsic web design, which is an evolution from the responsive designs and is about page layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he considers, three context matters is really the point here, that if a block isn&#8217;t displayed on screen, or on the phone, it still needs styling to consider the context. So it would be displayed as an inner block in a column display. It definitely also needs a different styling than when it&#8217;s in a single row by itself. That needs to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked up the expression intrinsic web design, because I wasn&#8217;t all that familiar with it. It was quite….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I don&#8217;t know that one as well. So I&#8217;m curious to hear more about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And it was coined by Jen Simmons, she brought the grid layout to us as a responsive design plus, and it&#8217;s fixing some of the shortcomings and hacks of the responsive designs. Without going any deeper, and here a couple of years ago, she did a great talk at the Event Apart, and we will have the video link in our show notes about that, where she breaks down how we address a flow layout or flex layout, grid layout, and then so forth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s definitely something that needs to get into the Gutenberg blocks, now that we are approaching page layouts with the site editor, there needs to be done some more work, as Matias says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In terms of technical aspect, is it less about using media queries to style your website and more about to make the design change according to the space it has? It&#8217;s more based on what&#8217;s the neighbors of your block, if it is something that is in the column, then classical media queries wouldn&#8217;t work because it&#8217;s still too narrow?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> That makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the viewpoints, of hard coded viewpoints that you see in a lot of designs, they not always apply, because the tablets get bigger, the phones get bigger, the phones get smaller, and then you watch it on a big screen, which is beyond the normal computer screen. The context changes so much on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that there are brilliant people in the Gutenberg team that can address it, but you needed to have the whole thing. I hear the rumblings that a developer needs to override the block, or a theme developer needs to override the block styling to get it into his own theme displayed nicely and all that. That is all part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the whole context of a page layout wasn&#8217;t yet clear how the column block or how a cover block with multiple inner blocks would be handling that. That&#8217;s certainly a problem to have and to be solved. I think that&#8217;s what I learned from Matias&#8217;s post, it&#8217;s very, very high on the priority there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes in with the panel directory now, that it&#8217;s available now, it needs to have a better integration with the inserter. And also get some multi-block transformer improvement, that you can transform maybe a cover block into a block pattern or a paragraph block or a quote block into a block pattern. And that flow also needs to be integrated into template parts and page layouts to add block patterns into those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I guess the most important part is that some of the block patterns that are in the directory aren&#8217;t so easy to use, because you need to copy them. I hope to see some improvements on that side. I guess that&#8217;s doable. It&#8217;s not that far away from that place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the meta team and the Gutenberg team worked on that already with the block directory, where you can search for a block in the inserter and then grab it and get it into your content. I think some basic architecture was already done there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> But it was only for a subset of blocks that were marked as core specific. So that&#8217;s a different story to make it work for everything that is sent to the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, the directory itself, the pattern directory right now only allows for core, for patterns that are built with the core blocks. It&#8217;s a similar process, there is no danger that the block that&#8217;s in the pattern wouldn&#8217;t be on the site. Well, unless it&#8217;s switched off. Yeah, there&#8217;s a block manager that it switch off&#8230; That&#8217;s definitely some issues that will need to be solved one way or other, or it will bubble up as a bug later on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third section that the Gutenberg, it is the navigation menus that will be the main focus for 5.9. It&#8217;s the new navigation screen as well as within navigation blocks. And there are definitely still some experience and display improvements necessary and reduced complexity was an expression that Matias uses in his post. And also that definitely needs to be tested, tested, tested, with as many themes as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, and you will hear me talk about it today multiple times, is that there is already a testing call. Anne McCarthy already posted the ninth call for testing for the full-site editing outreach program, and that is actually covering headers and navigation. We start with that already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth one, section four, Ventura&#8217;s roadmap or WordPress roadmap then is creating an interface for the theme JSON file. Right now, writing theme JSON manually in code is tedious. And the next step is to actually finalize the UI and the whole system is, we talked about it before, we covered it under global styles, where the user gets the chance to set those theme settings and configuration with the interface in a sidebar, in the site editor, that is also coming to 5.9. And the team has been working on that for quite a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth one is header design tools, colors, typography, spacing and layout. And one of the main goals would be a consistent access to the similar tools across blocks, and including third-party ones. And that the parameters and the settings are normalized between block JSON files and theme JSON file, when there&#8217;s block support or theme support, that they use the same taxonomy there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We had a lot of experimental features enabled in 5.8. I hope all of that is going to be stabilized, and we will have a consistent API. We are on a good path towards this goal. I&#8217;m positive about this one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And there&#8217;s a lot of testing also done, actually, I think Anne McCarthy also published a survey, we will highlight in the show notes, the results of it, where they connected with some theme developers on how they are using the theme JSON and what they liked and what they don&#8217;t like. So that is also great input for that phase of preparing for 5.9.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sixth section in Ventura&#8217;s roadmap 5.9 post was to formalize the editing flows for block themes and having a clearer information architecture for all the features, like editing templates, styling pages, creating whole template parts and all that. There was some great input from the full-site editing outreach program. So that will be iterated a lot, and also finalize the theme level blocks that have been experimental or have not been published for the&#8230; They&#8217;re in the plugin, Gutenberg plugin, but they&#8217;re not in WordPress core yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that concludes the preliminary. That&#8217;s a very big word there, roadmap for WordPress 5.9. The schedule is not out yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I guess the original plan was to have the release in December this year, but I don&#8217;t know, there isn&#8217;t a very detailed plan about that. So still probably involves and we will learn about that soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m thinking the core meeting later today would bring another preliminary schedule there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so if it stays with the schedule for December, then there will be future release in October, eight weeks before the release. That&#8217;s only two months away. So that&#8217;s a big roadmap for that. I&#8217;m sure there will be a cutoff date where we say, &#8220;Okay, this comes in or it doesn&#8217;t come in, or it&#8217;s ready or it&#8217;s not ready,&#8221; like we had it for 5.8.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a few community contributions today, we want to talk about. First, there is a new podcast. It&#8217;s called Tell Me About Blocks. And it&#8217;s an interview podcast about building extensions for Gutenberg, the WordPress block editor. And you can learn from guest experiences, creating block plugins, themes and block patterns. Michael Schneider is hosting that. It&#8217;s a monthly podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So July was the first episode and was with Keanan Koppenhaver. He&#8217;s a WordPress contributor and agency owner and plugin developer. He talks about his experience to do the Block-a-saurus plugin, which he just played around with the block editor to make it a little bit more fun. He&#8217;s also the maintainer of the Kanban for WordPress plugin that&#8217;s in the plugin repository.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second episode, Michael Schneider interviews Rich Tabor, and talks with him about the making of the latest plugins, Markdown Comments, and the to-do list plugin for the block editor, which are more collaborative plugins for the admin section of the editor, rather than for front end. I haven&#8217;t listened to the second one yet. Have you heard about it Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I only learned about this podcast yesterday. I subscribed. So I&#8217;m planning to listen to both episodes, because this is the area I&#8217;m the most interested about, in the development of the block editor and WordPress in general. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about the contributions from Rich, in particular about the markdown comments block, and the path, the journey that he had to send all his work to the block directory. So I&#8217;m just keen to learn more about the process and the experience in the form of the podcast that we all love, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, and so we wish good luck to our fellow partner, Michael Schneider, in Tell Me About Blocks. And you can read up about it, tellmeaboutblocks.com. It&#8217;s all one word, no dashes, no underscores, anything, tellmeaboutblocks.com. So you can subscribe to yourself, because you are listening to our podcast, so you are interested in podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a second announcement in the community contribution, which is from a team, of the WordPress team from the learn.wordpress.org team. And Hugh Lashbroke and Courtney Robertson have a proposal for brand guidelines for the Learn WordPress content. They asked plugin and theme creators if they want to contribute a course to the site. And the proposal handles the brand guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if there is, how they will handle shoutouts to other products that are outside of wordpress.org, but in the space. I think that should have your attention, and read through it and see what you think about it. Because definitely, the training team could use some help from more practitioners. It should be worthwhile for the brands as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And we need more tutorials how to build for the block editor, how to use the block editor. It&#8217;s all there, but it&#8217;s rapidly changing. We need to record new content. It&#8217;s only in your hands, and we are waiting for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. You make some great impact if you contribute that way to the WordPress project, and it&#8217;s what you already know. So you don&#8217;t have to learn a whole new thing. But you can influence millions of WordPress developers who wait for your wisdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to Gutenberg 11.3 release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>It&#8217;s still not out at the time of the recording. But we hope that it happens in any hour today. And anyway, we can cover what&#8217;s already in their release. This time, there isn&#8217;t anything in the changelog that would be marked as a new feature, although some of the enhancements listed are in the space of something that could be considered as a new feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a new color picker, an experimental component. We talked before about this project, that has this code, G2, like next generation of components. And the work is towards building a better UI for all those controls that you use with blocks, with global styles and such. And it&#8217;s still experimental. But the plan is to have different color pickers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can check out this work to see the difference that is there and if you like it or not, give some feedback. It&#8217;s still in the works, in development. So you have impact on that and can drive the future work on that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The G2 initiative is to make components much more accessible out of the box, so to speak, that a developer who uses those components, not only the Gutenberg developers, but also plugin developers and external developers can use those components and have an accessible experience, a more accessible experience out of the box. At least that was the new initial focus from Q and Sarah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And in general, there&#8217;s more to it. This concept of intrinsic web design, this is all about making this new set of components that they follow those principles. They adjust according to the context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other part is the team that is behind that. They are trying to unify the public API. At the moment, we must admit that some of the components were created a long time ago, and they were more like a realization of the current needs than the vision for the future. But this project helps us to bridge that gap, and make it much easier to use for all developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, thank you. So one of the enhancements is also the post featured image block received basic dimension controls for the image, which was something that was requested quite a bit. And that is when you use the query loop block or the post template, where you display the series of blocks and the featured image with it. You can also use it in the single post template, if you have a block-based theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, so just to remove some confusion that we discussed before the recording, is that this feature doesn&#8217;t quite work with classic themes. So it doesn&#8217;t have any impact on post featured images, unless you start using block-based themes, and all those designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think we need to, some of the enhancements that you said, we need to point out that this is not for classic themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> And there&#8217;s also a small change, a visual change, there are new icons for usable blocks and template part blocks. This is a special type of box that store the content in the database, and in the past, we had this logo looking like a Lego block. And now it looks like a stacked diamond. And the difference is only that one of them has the filled in background color, or something like this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a subtle difference, it shows that those two blocks are similar, but a bit different, the usage is different. It&#8217;s more for design and usable block is more for sharing the same content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And the stacked diamonds represent that it&#8217;s more a block collection than just one block. So the reusable block are the ones with just the outline of the stack diamonds, and the template parts display is the filled in stack diamonds. And you can distinguish them in the list view of the site editor or your post editor to identify them better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think that was the main motivation, because the list view is now persistent. When you have it opened, those visual cues are really important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The next item is for the block editor. Now, for the internal links, there&#8217;s also the rich previews enabled. So when you link to a post that&#8217;s on your own site, once you did the linking, and you come back to that post and hover over it, it gives you a nice little window with the title, the featured image and an excerpt. And it also gives you a little link where you can unlink that post again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is similar to a Google Doc linking mechanism. It really speeds up the quality control of your content when you go back and double-check on some of the links, is it really the right post and all that. And it takes care of, it uses the meta description and the Open Graph meta tags for that rich preview. So if your site doesn&#8217;t use those, you won&#8217;t get the rich previews, and it wouldn&#8217;t show. But most WordPress sites use them out of the box anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think it&#8217;s a game changer for content creators. I use this command plus trackpad click feature to check if the link that I used is correct one. You no longer have to do it, you just hover over the link and you have the hint for visible at your….</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing is that the button block, it has now padding block support. This one is quite different in how it has changed, because it&#8217;s not only a new feature that was added to the sidebar, but I think this is also the one that introduces a bit different UI experience. Is it this one or did I miss that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, it&#8217;s the next one. But this one is the padding. Now, padding has been around for quite a bit, padding and margin for cover block. And now it also comes to the button block. So it&#8217;s the sub block of the buttons block, where you can set the padding for all buttons or for the whole dimensions of the button, like the padding 20 and it adds them to the top, to the right, to the left and to the bottom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can unlink those sections, and then individually change the top left, right and bottom padding, as well as the padding for the button. You were talking about the next piece, there was the dimensions panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Dimension panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interrelated, because the new dimensions panel, it&#8217;s using two features, it&#8217;s controlling two features, which one of them is the padding and the other one is margin. The idea is that, with so many new controls showing up, for some blocks, it&#8217;s too much to process when you look at the sidebar. So there is this exploration that is already in the Gutenberg plugin, that allows you to use the drop down menu to pick what&#8217;s displayed inside the panel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can decide whether you want to display both the paddings and the margin or only one of them. And there is also this reset all feature, that just goes to the default state. So according to the discussions that are in this PR, you can find out that this type of interaction is considered for all other panels like typographic and color.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to how it changes, because it&#8217;s something that site owners requested for so long, to have better control over those features. Once we have that, apply to all features, it will be much easier to give also some coding APIs that will allow to control that from the code, so you could easily turn off all the features you don&#8217;t want to have on the side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And it&#8217;s also part of what Matias mentioned before in his roadmap post, that the consistency of having the controls all look alike. So once a user learns them, he can apply his knowledge to all kind of different places where that control can be used. And also how to handle a margin that is now different from a cover block to the theme parts sidebar. So that&#8217;s part of this normalizing and being more consistent in all the tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have a few bug fixes. There are quite a few bug fixes in this release. I just wanted to highlight one of them, that is that the custom gradient picker for left to right languages is now fixed. So now gradients work well, better again, from left to right languages. I&#8217;m a fan of gradients and everybody should have access to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s definitely a very nice feature. And there&#8217;s other bugs I want to mention in the template editor. And now, we show only post template actions for user with correct capabilities. So sometimes those features are very powerful. So you want to have better control who can access them. It&#8217;s something that is constantly looked at and improved. There&#8217;s so many new features added, it&#8217;s very easy to miss that part, that there should be permissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, this alleviates some of the anxiety that theme developers have, that any user can mess up their beautiful theme with changing some of the templates. But it&#8217;s now only restricted to the admin. That angst can be alleviated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also quite a few performance improvements that come with this Gutenberg release 11.3, and one of them is the lazy render block types in the inserter. It only shows block types that are necessary now. Have we talked about it before? I think that is an additional iteration of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It might be something different. As far as I remember, this one is the same solution that was used for block patterns. So block pattern does the previews and so on. It&#8217;s a lot of data to process. There is a special handler that just splits the list of all block patterns into chunks, and this solution was implemented also to the block inserter and improved the performance, like perceived performance of the inserter immensely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the difference you can see is that you will see small parts of the block types in the inserter at first, and the rest will just be iteratively added as the browser has free cycles to process that. So that makes the experience &#8230; because you can already start processing the block items in the inserter as they are rendered. In the past, you would have to wait until everything is ready. That&#8217;s a big improvement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So what I see in that PR is that Riad created a little page or website that measures the block editor performance and it&#8217;s titled, Is Gutenberg Fast Yet? I think we talked about it before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And where he sees the different items, how much time they use. And so he does some incremental improvements there and highlights all the different things that are keeping Gutenberg from being fast. It&#8217;s quite interesting for those who are interested in that kind of analysis, look at the PR in the site, and maybe you can help him figure out some of the performance hogs to make it even faster.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, also, speaking of Riad and all his efforts to improve the performance of the editor, he also posted on his blog, about the cost of WordPress lag is on the performance of the editor. So it&#8217;s a really good read, especially if you are one of the authors of blogs, and he just shows the results of measuring the impact of the most popular plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, he covers the plugins that add the functionality to the blocks, like additional features and how it impacts the performance. He covers also some recipes, how you can measure it on your own, when you are developing. The state of major plugins is really good, it has improved. As he was preparing this post, he reached out to some of those plugins, and they improved the performance, based on his findings. So it shows how the community is really into these performance improvements. That&#8217;s really great to see how it evolves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend checking out this post. He shares his approach how to process all that. There is also, it&#8217;s a follow-up post, because in the past, he had another post when he explained all the impacts of different approaches that you take when building blocks, using data stores, using rendering, and it&#8217;s very complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are really into block development, those two posts is definitely a must-have, if you want to provide the great experience for users, because performance is one of the most important aspects of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>I&#8217;m just scrolling through that, thank you very much for pointing out this post. I haven&#8217;t seen that yet. So definitely, we will share the link in the show notes. And it&#8217;s definitely an eye-opener in how plugins change performance. And he has some nice spreadsheets there, where you can look things up, and also how you can, as you said, how you can measure your own as well, if you develop a plugin for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, thank you. It&#8217;s also improved performance through the parser of removing the automatic custom classnames handling. What does that mean? I&#8217;m not so quite sure I understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s quite complex. But the difference here is that this was the responsibility of the block editor before, and Riad moved this logic to the block parser. It&#8217;s happening earlier in the process. And because of that, it allows to skip some of the….</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, when you have the classic block or you have the HTML, I don&#8217;t remember, other blocks, you know that for some blocks, you don&#8217;t have to do this processing, because they are not using this automatic classname handling. So you can skip that, that&#8217;s one improvement from start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also this ensures that the logic is executed only when really necessary. So when the block is valid, you don&#8217;t have to run that at all. But with the previous solution, it also was always applied. It had a really big impact when the post was really big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s very technical, and it&#8217;s something that a small group of people can really help with. But Riad, he&#8217;s just the king of performance. He knows who to do all this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> He loves to hear that, the king of performance. No, but it also shows that it only can be an iterative part that you can get it perfect, and you can get it to be more performant after the fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the experiment section of these release notes. It will highlight the template part placeholder now when you create a new template part with the site editor. So experiments has the full-site editing in there, and the navigation screen are the only experiments right now in the Gutenberg plugin that you have to switch on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site editor itself is actually already switched on. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s still in the experiments there. But when you create a new template part, say a header or maybe a sidebar item, it now asks you for a title as well in the create flow. So you don&#8217;t get as many untitled template parts as you got before. You can think about the title right when you create it. That&#8217;s definitely a improvement of the flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I also hear that the template part is going to be promoted to the stable feature. So it means that will be included in WordPress 5.9, for sure. And maybe that even will happen in the next plugin release. So, 11.4. And that&#8217;s great, because this is a very exciting feature. It will open a lot of possibilities, even for classic themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and now that it&#8217;s coming out of experimental means there are more eyeballs on it, to test it and to figure out what needs to be changed, or if it needs to be changed and what bug fixes are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the navigation link block, that&#8217;s a child block of the navigation block, now actually also has the ability to remove a link, which is certainly in the process of creating a navigation, a useful tool. Now, it&#8217;s there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think that brings us to the documentation section. And there is one item I wanted to highlight. Because we have those block patterns that you can search from the block patterns directory. And of course, some site owners don&#8217;t want to have them. So now there is a document explaining how you can disable that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That part was missing, but it was possible from the release, WordPress 5.8. So it&#8217;s now covered. If you don&#8217;t like that, you can check out how to disable that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, as any WordPress feature that is new, not only needs a way to enable it, it also needs a way to disable it, to make it as flexible as possible for all the WordPress instances that are out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us, so there are quite a few other smaller changes to the documentation that you can check out for yourself, because they are just changes to existing documentation pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Code quality, there is one highlighted that is the remove of the experimental prefix, and rename the theme JSON files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re theme developers, you now can remove the underscore, underscore experimental prefix on your theme JSON files as well. It will not read anymore from the experimental theme JSON file either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yes. And there is a small change in the API. So in the core data, there was a method to get authors, and it wasn&#8217;t very flexible. But it&#8217;s now deprecated in favor of get users, that allows you to pass the flag to return only authors. But also, it has a lot of other features that makes it better use. So it&#8217;s only changed to consolidate the API and make it easier to discover.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Thank you. Do you want to go through the tools section?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is one big change in that regard. So there is a lot of complaints about build tooling. And you related to that, because I was one of a few folks that were involved in updating Webpack to version five, and it was a pain. We started the first try in January, I guess, but it failed because of several issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we finally made it, and it&#8217;s going to be&#8230;. So the change is in the Gutenberg plugin already, and it has a good impact on the bundle size. It has decreased. It was 30 kilobytes or less that&#8217;s going to be sent to the user, which is a big win. So yay for Webpack 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> But there&#8217;s more to it. This change will also be applied in the WordPress scripts. We should expect NPM publishing for this package later this week. And so basically, if you are using default config files, everything should be good. If you are using your own custom config, then if you want to upgrade to the latest version, be prepared for some troubles, because it isn&#8217;t easy. Webpack isn&#8217;t backward compatible, to the degree that the WordPress is. It&#8217;s just what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, as we say, there will be dragons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> For sure, if you have a custom config, it&#8217;s not easy. I&#8217;ve been there already. And the next step, of course, will be to do the same update in WordPress core. There&#8217;s three places to update. I understand the frustration from people who try to use those tools by themselves. You have a lot of courage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Testing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And then there&#8217;s one other features that we will highlight from the testing section. And that is that the mobile team added a guide for integration testing, if I say this right, and it turns out to be quite complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, in general, we talked a lot last time about the barrier of entry for developing for WordPress. The way to start, even writing tests for the mobile apps is just on completely different level. It&#8217;s like a skier wrapper or something like that. It&#8217;s just so complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess this shows how the, not new web, but how the world evolves. You no longer only care about the browser, but there is also the phone, the tablet, and building apps for that. So if you are curious to learn how you could contribute to the native apps, if you are interested in this type of development, that&#8217;s definitely a good way to check and play with all those tools and see how complex the setup can be, if you are going outside of the web bubble.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;ve never really ventured into the native apps development. But I had hoped that React Native would be a path to go. And then I read, oh, by the way, this brings us to the end of the changelog. And we are now more in the section of active development, what&#8217;s discussed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we will share a post to Matt Chowning that he wrote about building an editor by sharing code between Android, iOS and web with React Native. It only brings you so far to reuse code base. And it seems that the mobile team recreated some of the Gutenberg experience, recreated them from scratch, reusing components, but not reusing some of the code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s quite an interesting read, finding out how complex that whole thing is when you do it through a phone screen and operating system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but the good point that the team, the WordPress mobile team is very happy about choosing React Native, and they emphasize that the speed of development is really good, because they can share the logic part of the editor that is developed for the web version. All the JavaScript code, they can reuse, and they don&#8217;t have to write it from scratch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s even more important, whenever there is a performance improvement, they get the same improvement on their side. And also, from my perspective, whenever they find something that is not working properly, they contribute back, so all parties win here. That&#8217;s the beauty of that setup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And everybody benefits from that. The mobile version is also part of the overall Gutenberg GitHub repository. So there is some synergy there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So two weeks ago, there was this big discussion about barriers to entry. And in our weekend edition, 180 and 181, on the Gutenberg Times, I shared quite a few blog posts and discussions on podcasts about that topic. So if you want to dive into it some more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Justin Tadlock from the WordPress Tavern, interviewed Matias Ventura, the Gutenberg Project lead on that. And it&#8217;s an interesting read, in that regard, that it really depends on the knowledge of who is developing for the web. And it&#8217;s a different perspective from someone like me who started with HTML, where only HTML was around. And it took about a couple of years before CSS came in. And then it took another couple of years before I needed to write some early JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I only had to add one little thing to my whole toolset. But it was also the speed of things. But latest in 2004, &#8217;05 or &#8217;07, I was left behind on all the cool development. And now caught up with it through WordPress, because that&#8217;s when we started, in 2010, we started with WordPress. And it took me about five years before I even had to touch code on a WordPress install to make a feature work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it really depends on where you come from. I jump from a ColdFusion development base to a very rudimentary PHP, to good JavaScript knowledge. The barrier is different for me, from someone to build a plugin, from someone who has 10 years of PHP experience and knows all the intricacies of WordPress, because for 10 years, she has been developing in that space. So that&#8217;s one thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Matias also points out that the theme creation, and the new on ramps for theme developers is so much lower than it was the last 10 years for theme development in WordPress. Because now you can start with the block-based templates, you can do block patterns, you have the theme JSON to control some of the features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you could basically write a new theme without touching code, because the site editor gives you all the tools with it, or at least that&#8217;s the vision in 5.8. The 5.9 will come close to it. And then with patterns, you can account any theme in any case very easily with just assembling a few blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also mentioned &#8230; go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think it&#8217;s very interesting to hear the vision from Matias, because he also shared this preliminary scope for WordPress 5.9. He knows what&#8217;s the end goal. And that&#8217;s much easier to see the landscape, how it will look in a few months when you will be able to fully benefit from all the latest development in the space of block themes. And that&#8217;s one way of looking at that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I think that in general, if you look at the development for the web 10, 15 years ago, you didn&#8217;t compete with mobile apps, and they didn&#8217;t exist at all. Everyone was using Nokia or other phones that only allowed you to play Snake or something similar, that was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the mobile apps, tablets, they change the perception what you can do, how you interact with those devices, and all the gestures and stuff like this, and animations and the performance. That was so much better because it uses some native technologies. So if you combine all those aspects together, it&#8217;s really hard to tell that the development should be still simple and the barrier of entry should be simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It cannot be, because we have so much bigger expectation as users these days. So of course, there are some libraries that help with that, but exploring the libraries, finding the right one and integrating that, it&#8217;s another level of complexity here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I also think there&#8217;s a level of decision paralysis, because if you have too many choices on the libraries, the chance that you pick the wrong one is really high. And then for some people, that is an existential decision. And if your business depends on it, it makes it an existential decision that a lot of other people depend on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see that, but it&#8217;s not only WordPress. All we know is WordPress, but it&#8217;s in all the areas that are out there that develop for the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Go on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, all I wanted to say was, when I look at what all needs to happen at the same time and play together, all the little pieces, it&#8217;s actually a miracle it works at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Because so many things could work. We should all be blessed that we actually can get something together that works well for millions of people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, I think we all were happy about the limitation of the web 15 years ago. You had the basic HTML, CSS was very basic. Now, there is CSS4. So the number of features that were added in the meantime is, scope is so gigantic, and you have to learn fifth method of positioning elements on the page. And also, you have JavaScript that has evolved, there are new features in the language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even PHP, if you look back, PHP 4 or 5, it&#8217;s a completely different language than PHP 8 that you have now with types and some strict checks and so on. And the tools that are around, that we didn&#8217;t have the interest back in the day, now it&#8217;s wildly popular. And end-to-end testing was very hard in the past. Now, you have so many tools to pick from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s up to you what you pick, because you could still use only PHP, HTML and CSS and some basic JavaScript and that should be fine. But the question is, if users will like it, or in terms of on the front end experience. But also, if the customers for all the businesses that WordPress supports, will be still happy to continue using very simplified interface, that is very technical.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think there&#8217;s so many things for many people. I think we will have a link to the WordPress Tavern article with the interview with Matias in our show notes. It&#8217;s definitely worth a read. And that brings us I think to the end of the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> One more thing, definitely look out for the Gutenberg Times newsletter, because it has a lot of links to those discussions. This week, you should expect more because those discussions still happen on the web, on Twitter, so be aware and look forward to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;ll have those in the show notes as well. This week&#8217;s weekend edition is not going to happen until next week, because I&#8217;m still….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> A suspense, nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> A suspense on that, because I&#8217;m still on vacation and I&#8217;m visiting family in Europe. But before we end, again, please heed the call. If you have some time, heed the call to the FSE testing call for number nine, working with the headers and navigation coming to the site editor to Gutenberg. We will need your input, we need to learn from your experiences and also from your expectations. What you tried to do, what you were able to do, and what didn&#8217;t work and what you expected how it would work. I think that would be really, really helpful for the team to come out of experimental stage and get into the main plugin with the navigation screen and block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, the show notes will be published on the Gutenberg Times podcast at <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">gutenbergtimes.com/podcast</a>.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the Gutenberg plugin release 11.2, and drag and drop, flex layout, core data shortcuts, and modern WordPress Development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times. I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziolkowski, code wrangler at Automattic, and WordPress core contributor. Good morning, Grzegorz, how are you doing? I am so glad that we have the same time zone together for the next two or three episodes. And good morning to our listeners, we are glad you join us again for this episode. How are you this morning, Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Good morning, Birgit. I&#8217;m so happy to be recording this one in the morning for the first time, it&#8217;s such a refreshing experience and something new. Everything is great here, and I guess the weather is similar at your place now, like in Poland, it&#8217;s changing rapidly everyday. Yesterday it was sunny, then raining, today it&#8217;s cloudy. So, you have everything. How about your place? How do you enjoy it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. We are on the same weather, it changes through the hour, we have one hour, we have sunshine, then we have thunderstorms and then it comes back. It&#8217;s almost like Florida. But I&#8217;m here in the makeshift office at my parents’ house, it&#8217;s kind of working from home home. It&#8217;s a little bit different, because it&#8217;s a big household, of course. And it took us an evening to distribute the fast internet that comes in on the second floor to the basement. But there is something like, it&#8217;s wired through the power grids, it is actually spectacular. It hard lined in through the network, it&#8217;s very interesting what they put together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> No, that&#8217;s really interesting. I&#8217;m keen to learn more after the show about that because I don&#8217;t have the cable to my office and sometimes the wifi isn&#8217;t great enough. And I miss that when I was preparing everything, I&#8217;m glad that there are some other ways to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;ll be happy to get deeper into that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Communication Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for our show today, the first section today is a community contribution, and I appreciate Chris Wiegman and Marcus Kazmierczak blogging about WordPress development in 2021. And they&#8217;re trying to define the barriers to entry for WordPress users, are they low, or they are high. I think we all are getting a few blurry lines, depending on what kind of stakeholders, or what kind of users you&#8217;re talking about. I haven&#8217;t read all of the blog posts, and I definitely need to read them again. But Chris Wiegman started the discussion on Twitter and I quote him, &#8220;The deeper I get with modern WordPress development, the more I understand why newer devs don&#8217;t like to work on it. This is not the same project that I was in, in the past. The learning curve is now extremely high, regardless of past experience.&#8221; Chris Wiegman on the Twitter verse, and we&#8217;ll link to that tweet in our show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are quite a few that chimed in on it. There was Alain Schlesser, Rich Tabor, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Matias Ventura.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Matias Ventura&#8230;.Yes, Jessica Lyschik as well from Germany, and Marcus Kazmierczak, I might have put just his name, last name, but I need to ask him how to pronounce his name. He wrote a blog post about modern WordPress development and, pretty much as an answer to Chris Wiegman, and Chris Wiegman actually put some more thoughts into it on his blog, with changing WordPress ecosystems. What do you think about, you came from a different content management system to WordPress, how many years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I started like with development with Drupal and it was like, maybe 10 years ago. And the entry level for Drupal is so high that going back to WordPress seems like you are in a familiar place and everything is so simple. So it really depends on your background, if you have a strong PHP background, then it might be easier to start with Drupal then maybe WordPress. If you don&#8217;t have any experience, it&#8217;s going to be hard no matter what you would like to do. So, it&#8217;s definitely a very complex topic. One thing that I would like to emphasize that WordPress has this badge with the fields of each of ours. So one of the sections is designed for the majority, it says that the way that WordPress is structured should be optimized for the end users rather for the developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is happening with full-site editing. And that&#8217;s why there is no, this impression that writing for the, like extending the block editor is hard and it&#8217;s something that definitely needs more attention, but it&#8217;s also a very complex thing to operate in this area of a very rich user experience and having so many features that so tightly related to the DOM, to the browser. So, it&#8217;s not an easy place to be when you are a developer. So I suspect that if you would like to achieve even like half of the goals that the Gutenberg gives you in the classic editor, I don&#8217;t think that it would be doable at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I like how Marcus iterated that the competition between WordPress, is for WordPress and it has had a remarkable growth rate, even in the last four years, going up to 42% and the competition is not Drupal, or Wix, or Squarespace. The competition lies through the social networks who made it so easy to create a post like on Instagram connect with Venmo, and then have a shop up there. So, following that path, there is an expectation from the users to also make it as easy as possible, and intuitive as possible. And of course the block editor is for quite a few developers, a moving target, the goalpost kind of still moves, because the team hasn&#8217;t finished developing it. It&#8217;s still on its way. And listening to Matt Mullenweg, he says, it&#8217;s going to be a 10 years, two years or four years, into a 10-year project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it would be that way and probably settle down quite a bit, but there is always keep moving, but I&#8217;m also wanted to outline, I found a tweet by Matt Edgar, who&#8217;s an editor and writer, and he says I fear that WordPress goes the Microsoft Ballmer way, where it&#8217;s all about developers, developers, developers, and not about users, users, users. So, that&#8217;s the whole other extreme there. And right now it seems to be on a middle path. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s the right path, but it&#8217;s at least kind of, if you offset both sides a bit. There&#8217;s something new coming by.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Chris Lema actually posted a, his latest blog post was about using WordPress without writing any code. And so that&#8217;s the goal pretty much, but he is actually preparing for a presentation on a non-WordPress conference. And, that don&#8217;t use WordPress all that much, but wants to make a case for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that blog post was very interesting to me as well, figuring out how to do this without, yeah. There&#8217;s a few plugins that he uses, but most of it is based on the native blog editor. So I think there is a great discussion going on and we all need to be a little bit more taking, and someone who has been successful with WordPress for 10 years and doing what they&#8217;re doing, bringing them all along, but bringing them piece by piece and also teach a lot about the new tools there, like react, yeah. MPM and all these new cool features that are hard to learn, sometimes when you haven&#8217;t been in this space for a long time. Yeah. I see it for myself, I came to WordPress from a total different programming language. And I programmed my own content management system until I saw WordPress offering so many features out of the box on their free plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to charge my clients that much for custom developers when there is a different system out there that you can use that they can use. And I started WordPress 10 years ago and it took only four, five years until we actually had to write code, PHP code. But I was a PHP novice, I didn&#8217;t get into it, until writing code, about six years ago or something like that in PHP. And it was so easy for an implementer to do that. And it will still be that, but I will never say, but for our clients, it was never easy to use WordPress when we say that it&#8217;s easy to use WordPress 10 years ago, it wasn&#8217;t really. There were multiple, was it a Tammie Lister who did a run down from how to change a theme at the beginning of Gutenberg, I thinks she had 62 steps to change the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I can imagine that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so, it&#8217;s getting really easier and easier, but of course there is a disruption there and we&#8217;ll use different tools there. So, I guess we have a lot of ready material for our listeners and we certainly wish that you communicate with us your ideas of what you think. And maybe also be a little bit more specific on, when you find it hard to work with WordPress. What exactly is it that trips you up, or that sometimes it&#8217;s small thing, sometimes it&#8217;s a big thing. And we all learn with that going forward, so we will have the blog, Chris Wiegman&#8217;s blog, his tweet and the thread around it, and Marcus Kazmierczak&#8217;s Modern WordPress Development, link to the WordPress Philosophy, and we also have Chris Lema&#8217;s Using WordPress Without Writing Any Code in the show notes for you to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to What&#8217;s released? The Gutenberg 11.2, do you want to get us into it?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 11.2</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Oh, sure. Let&#8217;s start with features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So this plugin release, it doesn&#8217;t bring so many new features. It&#8217;s obvious the reason why it happens is because there is a summer on the Northern hemisphere and a lot of contributors that I engaged with on a daily basis we&#8217;re not present. So, there&#8217;s definitely some slow down. This is also a great time to do some improvements for the developers, so they don&#8217;t feel left out. And there are also some efforts to improve performance, on the features level. So most of the work is around blocks and adding support, functionality, which supports something like colors, or border, and similar features. And the biggest change is this for the search block. It&#8217;s a bit strange when I learn about that, that you can add color support, but for the button that is in the search form. So, you can modify something similar to other blocks, like the background color or the text color, but it&#8217;s only for the button, and there is also a border color support, are they there? I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s the border is only for the button as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I tested it yesterday. I got a little bit sidetracked because I found a bug there, but not a bug, it&#8217;s the display thing, but the border color, as well as the support full border is actually for both the field, the input field, as well as the button. And you also can have different alignments for that. So it&#8217;s quite nice. You can actually, the example in the release notes or the make posts towards actually in a group block with, with image, background or color dual tone background, and then, search block on top of, it&#8217;s quite nice. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. And we use the border edges functionality, they have very nice effects, that you don&#8217;t have to use rectangles anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Found the borders in fashion again, so every 25 years we have rounded corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The good thing is that you need to use background images that swap with JavaScript on the fly like 20 years ago. But it&#8217;s back and the pullquote block, it also got board and color support. And the examples that were shared in the posts that described all the changes there is, includes very interesting effects, like you can use some sort of dotted border that use like very large dots and it creates a very nice FX for the pullquote. So I encourage everyone to give it a try and check some crazy values there and see how it looks like, because it might turn out that looks so nice that you would want to have it. And that&#8217;s basically all about features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we also have several enhancements, which one of them I would consider or other as a feature, this is a button that was added in the publishing flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you schedule or publish the post, there is the sidebar, that shows up on the, like, it goes from the right side. If you are in maybe a regular, no like, you&#8217;re using in English. And if you&#8217;re using Arabic, you will be go from the other side. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s confusing to explain. But anyway, the feature is that at the end, there is like summary, what has happened to which side you, you are using. And you can go and view the post there, but next to it, there is now a button that allows you to create another post. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s very useful because at least for me, I don&#8217;t really write another post just after I finished the one, I rather celebrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think it&#8217;s more for the micro bloggers that kind of want to upload an image and then do the next image like an Instagram post. But I like that it&#8217;s now trying to keep a user in the block editor for some publishing flows. I need to check, so it&#8217;s in the second step. Oh, it&#8217;s in the last step of the publishing flow. So you get the view post and as you explained it, there&#8217;s the add a new post button there. I need to test this out, how that behaves in the two-step process for the publishing process. So one of my pet peeves is that I started with the block editor. Can I log into my website and then already have add new post, at the first screen that I get to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t have to look for all posts and add new and all that. Because all I do on a website once it&#8217;s set up is publishing posts. So, I might just want to start there, but this is the end of it. So after I do one, I can stay in the block editor with it and update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;If you do photos, if you say, I want to just highlight certain links and then link out. I like it. So there is also some enhancements for the widget editor, and then for some of the components, but there seems to be a quite finite, not finite minuscule a little bit, not so obvious for people, but it makes the experience a little smoother. One of it is the core data, you can pass a query argument to a data selector shortcut. Could you explain that a little bit for me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So, the change for the core data is about passing. Mostly the context that is going to be used with the REST API. That was actually one of the missing features. So if you know how our REST API works, it allows you to fetch the data with different contexts. So let&#8217;s say to view, you get a different set of fields, then when you want to edit something and every REST API endpoint defines it differently. So thanks to this change, you can have full control over that when using core data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we had some bug fixes. One is for the Featured Image, now authors can select images that were uploaded by other users. So, if an editor uploads an image, now authors can also use them for the featured image and their blog post. And that&#8217;s certainly helpful, and reduces the duplication of images, probably quite a bit, in the media library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, definitely. One thing that I marked is that there was a change in the description of the embed block that was referencing Instagram. And I was surprised seeing that and turns out that Instagram is no longer supported as an embed in the block editor. So, that might be confusing. That was a fix, but it&#8217;s also good to know that Instagram embeds are no longer present in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think that was taken out last October when Facebook changed, how they, that you now needed a developer account with Facebook to use some of the, while the embeds, they no longer an embed publisher. So, now they changed it. There are quite a few fixes and, we had quite a few recommendations for plugins, and I certainly can reference that in the show notes again, but I think there was just an oversight to use Instagram as an example on how to use the embed with the Instagram, not doing it anymore. But the bigger problem was that it was showing up in the inserter when you started typing in Instagram. And so that would come up. So, that was leading the user a little bit astray on their publishing process. So, the one bug fix, also was the most used terms, we were running into a 403 error for non administrators, that has been fixed. And then we kind of tripped up a few users, I would imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So, most of the bug fixes where a smaller changes closer to the code quality improvements, like for the FocalPointPicker component, there is now additional check that verifies the type is correct. Like NAN which stands for, Not-A-Number in JavaScript. So, nothing really interesting, like this is just everything to ensure that there are no unexpected behaviors in some edge cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. But I&#8217;m glad that the team takes the time to go through that and fix those little things as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So then we had some performance updates and one of them pretty much only one that&#8217;s a drag and drop and it&#8217;s now, drag and drop is such a wanted feature. And it needs to work really well to be useful, and Kerry Lui did some changes there and fixes there. So I don&#8217;t understand exactly what the changes were there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I don&#8217;t know. I know, it&#8217;s very complex related to how the browsers work. So, if you are keen and learn how you can profile the performance of layouts and, CSS, how it works, the drag and drop, it&#8217;s very well explained in the PR that&#8217;s linked and Kerry, she&#8217;s doing fantastic job on that field. She has a lot of expertise. So you can follow along if you want to learn more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one thing that I checked, one when playing quiz is that in the last episode, I was wondering if it is possible to drag and drop a block from the list view to the editor canvas or the other way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it turns out that you can, and I was surprised. Yes, I don&#8217;t know how it works because I don&#8217;t think it contributed anything to that functionality at all. But it&#8217;s very well designed. If you can do so, so interesting interactions. One thing I noticed that there&#8217;s a bit of delay when you drag from the list view to the canvas, then it updates in the canvas and then the animation starts in the list view. So, it&#8217;s not the perfect experience, but you know, it was right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Right. But it seems that that&#8217;s something that Kerry was working on to avoid layout and repaints, but you definitely need to have it. So it&#8217;s all in the right order when you drag it from one canvas to the list view and back. So I can see that that&#8217;s a great challenge for programmers to get right, yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and that brings us to the experimentation or the experiment section. And right now, Riad started to put in a prototype and this plugin for a flex layout supported by the block editor. You made some notes on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. Because I first wanted to try how it works, but it turns out that it&#8217;s not that simple to, that on your website. So first of all, it&#8217;s an API change and that API is hidden behind a special flags. So if you add the examples for the group block and to enable that you need to change the block JSON file, for the block, and there is experiment layout already present, but it&#8217;s set to true. If you want to use this new feature, you need to choose an object, and there is all over switching flags, but this API is still in progress in, we will change for sure, because Riad left a ton of notes, how it can evolve. So he said that we could introduce more layouts, such as grid or absolute position in container. So it&#8217;s really nice when you play with that, but there&#8217;s one more thing, it only works with full-site editing themes, that content theme JSON file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It needs to be set in the block JSON, black JSON, as well as on theme JSON?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> No, we don&#8217;t need to do anything in the theme JSON but you need to have a theme that have this file, because this experimental layout, it only works for you if it&#8217;s full-site editing. I know it&#8217;s quite confusing, but I learned the hard way trying to play with that. But once it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s really nice. So when you change to the flex, then if you had rows, then you suddenly have items next in one row next to each other. And even if you go and try to move the one of the inner blocks, then the arrows, will be to left and right. So they adapt to the layout, which is pretty nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I think there was, years ago, there was an issue that one that, that I also, and I put an actually in the actively discussed. So let&#8217;s talk about it again there. So for the Changelog, there&#8217;s a lot of testing updates and a lot of build tooling updates. Is there anything that stand out that you wanted to talk about today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There isn&#8217;t anything that would count my attention. So I don&#8217;t have anything to share. I mean I could but-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, you could probably another hour or so about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I&#8217;m thinking mostly about our listeners and what could be interesting for them? So I didn&#8217;t identify anything this time, but there&#8217;s a lot of them and mostly this is related to the constant improvements to-end-end testing. And the fact that it&#8217;s almost stable these days, which is a great improvement for all the contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, absolutely. And there is actually a new testing team, not a new team, but the test team has more new reps. And Tonya Mark has written about that on the test blog. And so they all, some contributors that wanted to get deeper into testing of new versions of the WordPress core, as well as on Gutenberg and have more look at the tickets for needs tuner tests or needs E2E tests to, and add those flags to the tickets. So it can be quite a bit more stable, when it comes out in beta. So I think that&#8217;s a good development here too. And if you&#8217;re interested in that, I think that the test team can use your assistance there and your help and your expertise. Of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So I think I have one thing, Riad Benguella, he’s exploring a special website that would track performance metrics over time for the Gutenberg editor. So, It&#8217;s the same thing that you see every time when a new Gutenberg release post is published the bottom of every post, and that would be something that like a chart that would show you how it changes with every Gutenberg release. So, to save some historical data, if that&#8217;s working, that would be really nice to observe how it all changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, nice. I just clicked on the link that was in the PR. So I&#8217;d like it. It&#8217;s a website that&#8217;s on Versal, and talks about the different, the type speed, the inserting, the opening, insert opening, insert of hover items, the load of the whole editor, selecting block, selecting and insert a search. So it&#8217;s quite nice. Yes. I linked through the additional site as well in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there were some documentation changes. Some of them were as minuscule as adding a missing space or changing an intake, but one of them is the missing IATN, the internationalization filters for the documentation that was caught by one of the developers on Twitter and turned out it didn&#8217;t come over from when the documentation is automated or is imported into the WordPress developer handbook. So that has been fixed now. So you get all the filters that deal with internationalization of your block editor assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice for plugin or if they want to modify translations. And it existed there since WordPress 5.7. So, quite a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Sorry, it wasn&#8217;t in the documentation. And there was one block API change where you, I think it was one of your PRs, how to improve block assets or versioned. And what&#8217;s the background of this and why was that important?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Oh, it was purely technical on the WordPress core side. So there were some concerns that we were using the file time function, which is based on the five system to generate version for style sheets, which when you have more complex setup, like several servers, then the value might differ when load balancer kicks in. So, it&#8217;s fine for a single website, but for more complex, it&#8217;s not so reliable. So, the idea is that, we now have in block JSON version field, so you can provide the version of your block, and that is used for style sheets to define whether browsers should load a newer version of the same style sheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s kind of to bust out of the cache, for the style sheets. that&#8217;s very interesting. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. Even if it&#8217;s not provided, then the WordPress version will be used. So, it&#8217;s still not a big deal if someone forgets to do it, but in some cases, if you resolve, and then you probably should add that to our blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It makes it definitely explicit, it&#8217;s probably better than just assumed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there were some code quality issues that were resolved or checked. One of them is a performance issue, that&#8217;s the refactor of the post author component. But George Mamadashvili, short MamaDuka, he refracted it, so it only requests fields that are needed for the rendering, like the ID and the name, and that reduced the trend data transfer considerably by roughly 50%. So, these kinds of changes or behind the scenes, they&#8217;re very technical, but it&#8217;s really important to know that they are happening. Good. So this brings to the end of the changelog. Yeah. It&#8217;s a good release and try out all the new features. And there is one discussion that we mentioned earlier was about the flex layouts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the prototype is in the plugin, Riad Benguella who published that also opened another issue to discuss further iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;ll have it in the show notes for you. It&#8217;s 3-3-6-8-7, the issue. And he describes the current state of the floor layout and the flex layout. And then the, an experimental way to switch between the two, as Grzegorz mentioned earlier, and then also outlines concepts that were resolved in a refactoring of some of the blocks to a declarative behavior on context, but Matias Ventura also chimed in and mentioned the grid layouts to be worth exploring as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you dear listeners want to get in an early discussion of a new feature, this is the time for this feature, subscribe to the issue, chime in in the discussion, and lend your expertise and your ideas to the developer team. I know that way back in 2019, for instance, I think in November &#8217;19, Automattic published a grid layout block. And I wonder how many of the learned lessons can be applied to the core editor. So I&#8217;m also linked to that particular plugin and had his last updates were three weeks ago. So it&#8217;s still on, and it has about a hundred thousand active installs. So it&#8217;s definitely something people are looking for, and your discussion, you can definitely contribute to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> From my perspective, I think that the biggest advantage of the current exploration is that it or uses it an existing block and only add it as a feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, this is our bell, it&#8217;s the end of the changelog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we are at the end of the show, and I want to remind everyone too, if you have something that we should talk about, what questions or news that you want us to include, send them to email, <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com</a>. If you want to write a review, if you like it, write a review for us, please in either the iTunes or Stitcher, or any other of the podcast directories, it would really help us to spread this wide and far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Well, thank you, Greg.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the release week with WordPress 5.8 out the door, followed by the new WordPress.org pattern directory, and Gutenberg 11.1. We&#8217;ll also discuss what&#8217;s next with Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times, and I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Grzegorz Ziolkowski, code wrangler at Automattic and WordPress Core contributor on the Core editor team. Good afternoon, Grzegorz. How are you doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hi, good afternoon. I&#8217;m great, feeling relaxed. It&#8217;s the middle of the summer. The weather is good. It&#8217;s so nice to meet you again. How are things on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, we are getting ready to jump over it on a plane to head to Germany in a week. We are glad that we finally can visit our parents after two years. We&#8217;ll stay for a while and work from home-home, like the real home. We think of our parents&#8217; homes as home still. We&#8217;re again quite excited, and we&#8217;ll stay for a long time, for five weeks to eight weeks. Really our parents are delighted, it is the least to say about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: That&#8217;s really exciting. Also we will be on the same side of the ocean when you fly to Germany, and also it&#8217;s the country next to Poland, so that&#8217;s exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Same time zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We will be a few hours away. Same time zone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Same time zone. Makes scheduling so much nicer. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to travel a lot to other places than just hometowns like Munich and Saarbrücken and Freiburg, Kenzingen, so it will be more on the southeast side than on the northwest side or northeast side, but I will go back to Poland very soon. I really loved Warsaw when I was there. It&#8217;s now five years ago. I met so many nice people there. It was really great. I want to go to Krakow, I want to go to Danzig. They&#8217;re a German word, so it&#8217;s really ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> You should go visit Ratzwaf, my hometown. It&#8217;s eight hours away from Munich by car, so I recommend that one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 5.8</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I&#8217;ll definitely do that, but getting back to our Changelog here, what&#8217;s being released? There were a lot of things happening in the WordPress space this week, especially around Gutenberg and the new features in WordPress 5.8. We will catch up with it also in upcoming episodes, but for this week, I&#8217;m quite busy from all the releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Who isn&#8217;t?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I don&#8217;t know how you all do it. I think a lot of people are doing on it. WordPress 5.8 Tatum is out. It&#8217;s named after the American jazz pianist, Art Tatum. If you ever had hear him play, there are quite a few videos on YouTube that I played them. He&#8217;s a virtuous jazz piano player and it was just amazing to listen to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release is the reflection of hard work, of 530 generous volunteer contributors. Collaboration occurred on over 320 tickets on track and over 1,500 pull requests on GitHub. These are mind-boggling numbers, but that&#8217;s what Matt Mullenweg wrote in his release announcement. Yay contributors and yay Gutenberg team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, that release is spectacular, in my opinion, one of the biggest at least since I joined the Gutenberg core team and I&#8217;m contributing to the core. This release is really packed with new features. As probably our listeners already know, because we talked about them quite a lot, this is the block widget editor, template editor, duotone feature, list view, and the new preference modal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it&#8217;s not only the WordPress 5.8, it&#8217;s also new WordPress packages. All the updates were published just after the release went out, so if someone is using pieces of WordPress in a different way, they also can benefit from all the same functionality to everything that was added to the Gutenberg plugin after the release was cut out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s awesome. Those who use Gutenberg and Drupal or those who use Laraberg also get these updates in their system. On the evening of July 20th was the release date for 5.8, but on the evening, the meta team also announced that the first version of the WordPress pattern directory is live, and it comes with a ton of curated block patterns that were curated by the design team as well. Now you can just copy-paste them into your block editor. How cool is that?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block patterns are available in 13 languages, so the polyglots not only had to translate the WordPress 5.8, but also block pattern sites. Many more languages will follow. Shout out to the polyglot team that had to work on a lot of more translations than usual for a release. I think 55 locales, not necessarily languages, but 55 locales are actually 100% already finished up the translation for 5.8. That&#8217;s really amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s impressive. It always amazes me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The pattern directory has, I don&#8217;t know, over 80 patterns in there and the patterns themselves are also released. There was a moment in time before the release where you saw the same pattern in 15 different languages, it was just interesting, where you had all the Korean signs and the Chinese signs and then the Hebrew. It was, I&#8217;d say, wow, this is amazing. It&#8217;s a worldwide project. Sometimes we forget about it, but when you see all the languages coming in, it&#8217;s so eye-opening for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but this is not all because we had block widgets editor enabled. The BuddyPress team, they released a new version, 9.0.0, and it contains &#8230; they transform all the legacy widgets into blocks, so you can use them now on the widgets screen. That&#8217;s a great way to start with blocks when you try to convert shortcodes or widgets into blocks. Then, of course, on Wednesday the Gutenberg team released Gutenberg 11.1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a good point with converting widgets and shortcodes into blocks, yeah. I think you can connect with a BuddyPress team, and if you have trouble, connect with them and see what they did and how they did it and what trouble they had and how they overcome that. I think that will be a good way to start if you haven&#8217;t worked with blocks yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 11.1 &#8211; Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Gutenberg 11.1 comes with a lot of enhancements. I really like that release because some of the blocks actually got some additional features. It was more a content creator and those who work with blocks to actually publish things get a lot more features now again after many, many releases where it was more about foundations and it was more about the future of Gutenberg rather than the here and now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think that&#8217;s the benefit of having this big WordPress release out, that contributors can finally focus on bringing maybe not big features but some small enhancements, some small improvements about their workflows that improve that daily work for the whole group of people who are using Gutenberg, not only those who are waiting for full-site editing but also all the users that use it for a few years now and can benefit from all the feedback chart during that time and it&#8217;s now materialized into nice user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Speaking about user experience, Ella van Durpe has added a PWA, and we talked about it I think on our last show, a little bit about it, but PWA is a progressive web app that you can install on your mobile phone. She has normally the front end of a website is installed as a PWA on a mobile phone, but the backend lives from the mobile responses side of the desktop version.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ella did something else and it allows the WordPress admin to be installed separately as a home screen and you have easier access, and it&#8217;s separated from the front end. I tested it yesterday quite a bit and it works very well for adding content to a site from your mobile phone. I used it together with the Hypernotes plugin, that&#8217;s a private notes-taking app, and it works very well with the PWA features there. I can make notes when I&#8217;m on the plane, on my phone. When I&#8217;m on the internet again, it updates the site when I&#8217;m back online, so that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I guess the offline support is only for the plugin you mentioned that Ella published together with this change, because I don&#8217;t think that it would work out of the box for the regular post or page publishing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I will need to test this. Right now it&#8217;s just theory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, but I guess that&#8217;s the ultimate goal, to have the support. That would be a game-changer for all the content creators. They could just write wherever they want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s the aim for it. I hope. There might be some overlap, just for those who test it out, with the PWA plugin that the WordPress team at Google put in the repository and has already add quite a few installs, I think about 40,000 installs, active installs, but I saw on those PR notes or issue notes that one of the developers, Wes Rutter, is actually actively working on the Google PWA plugin to avoid any possible conflict with the Gutenberg WA experiment there. We&#8217;ll see how that works out. Good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> We have some enhancements also to the blocks. One of them is at least the block, it has now link color control. For instance, columns block, it has a new feature which allows to stack columns on the mobile screen. Instead of having six columns displayed in a tiny screen, now you can enforce the setup wherein just like every column tags the full width of the screen. It&#8217;s a very nice enhancement that probably many website owners had to work around with CSS now it&#8217;s natively supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and it&#8217;s supported without actually mobile breakpoints because those are moving targets. You don&#8217;t have to set them out, but you could if you want to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PR that&#8217;s linked in the release notes, there were quite a few discussions and design testings, and everybody shared how they worked it out and what still needs to be done. I find it quite educating to go through that and read up about what the problems were, how they were solved and how they fixed the edge cases on it. Sometimes you just go and read up a bit some of those PRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, in this release, the post term block now has support attribute for the separator. Sometimes, you want to separate them by comma. I think that&#8217;s the default. The separator of the post terms, so when you have multiple categories or multiple tags for a post, you can now also decide on the separator. You could even use emojis as a separator, I&#8217;ve seen. That&#8217;s quite funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think there is also for the tag cloud block, there were some changes that removed editor styles that were causing the different presentation in the editor and on the front end. I don&#8217;t see that so often these days, but there are still cases that are actively being improved, and that&#8217;s great, because the goal is just to have one-to-one experience. Especially with the full-site editing view, that will be very important because people don&#8217;t want to jump between the preview and the editing mode too often and anywhere in one canvas, not like in Customizer when you have this sidebar and you edit inside there. It&#8217;s just one place to edit everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a little bit different from the block editor in the post and page screen. When you go there on preview, you open up the front end and look at it, but in the template editor, that&#8217;s not how the preview works. It&#8217;s a little bit different for the template editor. Really, I just read it again, and I really like that you now have the ability to change the number on the tags that are shown. If an editor puts 20 tags on a post but your designer says, &#8220;We only show five of them,&#8221; so you can put those in as a setting on the tag cloud block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also for the link editing. It was a little bit cumbersome where you have to figure it out by osmosis, I guess, how to unlink a section from the link, and there is now an unlink button. It&#8217;s more on the link control pop-over. It&#8217;s more a link rather than a button, but now you can just click on it and the link disappears again, which I think is nice. It&#8217;s a fast way to do this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There is also a very important enhancement that we probably should mention earlier. This is for the change for the list view. Now, there is support for drag-and-drop functionality. Previously you would have to go to the canvas of the editor and just grab one of the blocks, which is, some blocks take a lot of space, so sometimes it&#8217;s really hard to precisely pick the place or scroll the screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you have this much smaller handles because it&#8217;s just one row in the list view and you can just take it and drag it to another place. It&#8217;s much more smoother experience and much more easier to put the block exactly where you want, especially when there are a few levels of nesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s a really nifty feature. I tested it then I&#8217;m just, wow, this is a game-changer. Now you can put something that&#8217;s off the screen, grab it, and move it just up to a higher place on the post without having to screen things or if you don&#8217;t get it right in the selection, and then you just &#8230; it&#8217;s so much nicer because the drag-and-drop from off the screen to up the screen, off the screen, it was a little cumbersome, but if you use a list view drag-and-drop, it&#8217;s so much easier to change things around. Yay, good work, team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The one thing that I just thought about is, can you drag something from the list view to the editor, or the other way around?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No. No, you just drag it up and down the list view, but it will be copied on the editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s something that people would want, but it&#8217;s a nice technical challenge, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s a testing challenge. Good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I just wanted to tell that there is one small enhancement. When there&#8217;s only one block in the drop-down menu in the block&#8217;s toolbar, that&#8217;s from the three dots icon, you could move to even there was only one block, which was impossible. Now this is fixed. It&#8217;s more like a bug-fixing in my opinion, but it&#8217;s also an enhancement for the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> In the same region, it&#8217;s pretty much disable the post publish button if it&#8217;s saving non-post entities, if the meta tags or something like that is saved, non-meta box items that are in post meta. Also the preferences have publish label and consolidated option in the preference modal that was just released, and of course it&#8217;s the second iteration of it, and it gets some new updates then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I really like this new &#8230; not that new, but the way how it evolved and everything is consolidated in one model. That makes it easier to discover all the options that are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;m just still not getting, for many, many years, now I can say it for many, many years, it&#8217;s more than three, I would like to have the block manager be a little bit more feature-rich because if I switch off a block, I would really want to know if I used it multiple times, especially when it&#8217;s a block that comes from plugins. If I want to do a review, which blocks did I use and all that, I need a separate plugin to do that. I think it would be really helpful if it were out of the box in the block editor, but yeah, I&#8217;ll try my best and there are some plugins out there that can be a good inspiration for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I agree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s my soapbox of the block manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>APIs&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> On this note, we can move to the new API section. There are two changes there. One of them is, in the Gutenberg plugin, we have now a new stable endpoint which allows developers to get the list of block editor settings. It&#8217;s more or less the same what is exposed from the server for every instance of the editor, but this one is a nice way to grab the same set of settings for a special way of dealing with the editor. The mobile app is a great example because this is the actual use case in this case, but it also gives the opportunity for other plugin developers to find ways to build their own instance of the editor and have all the settings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other change is that we now have a new search control component that&#8217;s inside the WordPress components package or under WP.components.globalnamespace inside the editor. This control was used in a few places, so it was just extracted to make it available for third-party usage, which is a really nice simplification if someone needs that UI interaction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you, yes. Back to the block editor settings, what kind of settings would that be? Is it per block or is it the editor itself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> No. It&#8217;s per screen. At the moment, there are two different screens out of the blocks. One of them is for the widgets and the other one is for that post/page editor which is hard to tell what will happen with the site editor if it will be a new screen in the future, but that&#8217;s the distinction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you get from there is there is a set of some default settings like all the types of the images you can use in the editor or you can get list of color presets, you can get the list of phone size presets. There is all those features that you have, and some of them can be customized and changed by the plugin with a big range of filters. In general, it&#8217;s all those things that you would like to customize for your site, and that&#8217;s set on the server.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It would also be something like the screen has a full-site editing mode or the spotlight on or something like that? Is that part of that endpoint?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah, some of those settings might be there. If the full site editing team is enabled, that would be one of the settings, but for the spotlight, I think it&#8217;s only set on the client side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The best way to check is just go to the WordPress code base and check all those options. Maybe it&#8217;s documented somewhere. If not, we probably should do that and expose in the developer documentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m assuming then, from the list that you had, it reads the theme JSON file or from the theme as well, so you get all the color palettes and all that. Good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. It compiles from the different servers, so it&#8217;s not only that, but also some existing functions that are in the WordPress for quite long that you normally use like, for instance, a set of image presets like the thumbnail, large and so on. Just consolidated in one API. I know that the folder for the REST API endpoint, there is always an API schema. This is a good way. Probably this is how it will be documented because this will be published to the REST API documentation, so you have automatically generated docs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Exactly. That&#8217;s definitely a place, when you write plugins or themes, to check it out and see if you can refactor some of your work before because that is now much easier to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were just some performance features. One is, we talked about the list view, and the team also improved quite a bit the performance on it. That&#8217;s all in one package, but it&#8217;s in different places here in the changelog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few accessibility improvements here, but one is highlighted that the high-contrast mode is now available for the icon buttons. That certainly is for those who are visually a little bit impaired.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bug Fixes&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were 34 bug fixes and there are some of them are cosmetics, some of them are just some edge cases, like the search block button position drop-down had some accessibility issues that are fixed. Now you can change the border radii. Sometimes when the Italian word has a different plural, sometimes it makes it into English language and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. Comma and commas, it doesn&#8217;t, but radius and radii, it does. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a little chuckling a bit as I&#8217;m reading through this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There was also a bug fix for the duotone feature. Now, it allows to avoid rendering duplicate style sheet and SVG files. As far as I remember, there was a change that consolidates all the changes to duotone and it&#8217;s moved to the footer, so that improved the readability of the DOM tree, which helps with CSS styling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also some technical changes. That was targeting the widget screen. That shows how the required compatibility is important in WordPress. In the past, long, long before the Gutenberg was a thing, there was the classic editor that was exposed under WP.editorglobal. When the Gutenberg was born, it was also put under the same namespace, which probably wasn&#8217;t the best idea in retrospect, but to work around that, there is now a special so-called “shin” that allows those two objects to coexist and they just merge together and show that all the functionality is exposed also on the widget screen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Exactly. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I know that there was also a last-time change for WordPress 5.8. There was this fix for select-all, if you are using mark comment A shortcut. The way it worked in WordPress 5.7 was if you wouldn&#8217;t have any selection, it would just copy all the blocks, whereas for WordPress 5.8, it didn&#8217;t quite work, but eventually the last approach was that if you click anywhere in the editor&#8217;s canvas, then it will copy all blocks, but if you use this comment A shortcut, when you click, for instance, on the header, then it would just work as in on other websites. There&#8217;s these distinctions that in my opinion make sense, but maybe it&#8217;s confusing for users if they are familiar with the old behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Thank you for pointing that out. I didn&#8217;t realize that, but it makes total sense. What we heard from the tags block were the editor screen and the front end screen is matching the layout, that goes actually &#8230; some of the big fixes where these kinds of changes, where some of the styling that was applied to a block or after the block has been removed so it better matches the front end. It goes through quite a few of those updates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who work on the theme JSON and try to switch off and on some of the features, like the color duotone or the spacing units, you now can add empty values in the JSON file to signal that there is no feature for that. All right, that brings us to the &#8230; there&#8217;s one item that&#8217;s highlight that extracts snack bars into a separate component. Is it lunchtime yet?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I&#8217;m after lunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You&#8217;re ready for dinner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> &#8230; but I guess it made you hungry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Made me hungry, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s a funny name for this little pop-up that shows up in Gutenberg on the bottom left of the screen after you do some impressive action, like you publish a post. There was some issue with the layering, so this is Z index in CSS. It was covered with something, it was fixed, and it was also extracted to its own section in the abstraction that is built inside the block editor which is called layout in the interface package. There&#8217;s some planned follow-up work for all the notices to have a special handling, so they are always displayed on top of everything else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah. Makes sense. It&#8217;s not covered up and people don&#8217;t know if it worked. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Experiments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Now we can go to experiments. We have 16 items in this section. It&#8217;s not the usual number we saw in the past because some of those experiments are now in Core, so that&#8217;s a great progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Or are in the Gutenberg plugin. They&#8217;re not necessarily all in Core because the full site template editor is not yet in Core, the site editor stream, but it&#8217;s out of experimentation. The plugins, when you install it, you have it right away and don&#8217;t have to look in experimentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiments are actually only three sections now. That&#8217;s a component system, it&#8217;s a G2 we talked about quite often already, but it&#8217;s now getting into the plugin, and then there&#8217;s a navigation block and the screen and the global styles. They are still in experimentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> In the component system, we have a new experimental component, so to speak, and it&#8217;s called flayout. Flyout?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Flyout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Initially, the idea was to call it pop-over, but this name is already taken by the existing component, but it has some different mechanics. It was really hard to map the new functionality to the old one, so the decision was made to just introduce a new one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The follow-up work is planned to use this flyout in as many places as possible and figure out if the old components still need to exist or it can be duplicated or just maybe the name will be pop-over after all. It&#8217;s really hard, all those changes for the UI to make it happen, especially when you know that so many projects use those components, which is both handling but also brings this complexity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> If a plugin developer develops a block or something like that, they could use all those components, right, and experiment with it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: Yeah. They can, but there is no guarantee that the API will stay and they are also prefixed with underscore, underscore experimental. Use it at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Don&#8217;t try this at home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> It&#8217;s always like when you are in States, you just need to sign a waiver before using any of the….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Experiments, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> &#8230; excursion of ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Navigation block is getting some attention now that all the widget things is at least released in its second iteration and has quite a few changes there, be it from color options for the sub-menu to improved handling of the overlay to the inheritance of the placeholder for the menu item. Also made it into the release is a refractor of the navigation block rendering using allocation attribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The change is for global style. Sound very technical even for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We talk about that a little bit on a higher level when we talk about what&#8217;s next for Gutenberg.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the changelog, we&#8217;re coming to the documentation section, and that definitely had quite some updates that are interesting for the developers that are working on extending Gutenberg.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I guess at least for the block API and for block editor API, this is something I worked on, it&#8217;s all the content that you would be familiar if you read Dev Notes for the same topic, but it&#8217;s brought to the documentation. I think the more interesting part, at least for myself, is the theme JSON changes. We have now examples and highlighted backward compatibility usage. That&#8217;s quite important I think to look at if you are experimenting with this theme JSON format.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> With that, of course came an update on the format with the WordPress 5.8 changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Also for the same topic, I think the biggest challenge now is that there is still an active development, so new features are added. In the documentation, it needs to be very clear what&#8217;s already in WordPress Core and what&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg plugin experience, so I think there is also an entry and a change that covers that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a good point. I think the last few years, there was quite some confusion. Especially when you have plugins and you need to gear it towards multiple versions of WordPress, who is on 5.7, who is on 5.6 to make that all work was, even if the new features come, you need to go back and say, not for you, not for you, not for you in your code. It&#8217;s not for WordPress 5.1 or 2 or 3 or 4, but it&#8217;s only for 5.6 and 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re coming to code quality changes, and it seems that there are quite a few that you could be talking about that changed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I highlighted changes for the API fetch that we discussed in the last episode. There was some follow-up on that front. Now there is a user auto-completer component in the block editor that doesn&#8217;t use this API fetch directly by the abstraction built on top of that. The same applies to the latest post block. Those things are in motion and very quickly are changed in the WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are new components that were &#8230; those components were experimental: the gradient picker and the custom gradient picker. Those two components are now considered stable, so everyone is encouraged to try them out and to use in their products. The backward compatibility will be assured from now on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> This is the keyword for me is gradients! I love gradients, yes, and I like that we have them in Gutenberg so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were some additional tool changes, 16 of them for testing dependencies and workflows. Now, previously-skipped widget tests are now enabled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There&#8217;s some back and forth. I highlighted those items that I consider interesting, that some tests were enabled, they&#8217;re disabled, enabled again. It&#8217;s very important for the projects to have a reliable verification from end-to-end tests, unit tests and all sorts of tests that you can come up with. It&#8217;s a very strong emphasis to have that always be something that you can look at and say, &#8220;It&#8217;s working. I can just merge the change,&#8221; because otherwise, if there&#8217;s so many contributors, it will be impossible to keep the pace on the tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, keep the pace or not. I have to go back and do a regression testing as well, which you do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> There are also some new tests other than that. I encourage everyone, if they want to figure out how they could contribute with code, so finding a piece of UI interaction that isn&#8217;t covered through this test and writing end-to-end tests is a great experience in both to see how this automation works, how you can see the interactive mode and look how computer is just doing user interactions in your Chrome browser. That&#8217;s really nice experience and really rewarding when you make it go and to test passes and all the verifications are checked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s instant gratification. What can be better than that? I have found that that&#8217;s my programming style is I need instant gratification. I can&#8217;t wait until everything is compiled and all that. That&#8217;s why HTML was so fabulous for me. I can see it right away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> With CSS, it&#8217;s even better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s even better? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> You just open dev tools and just change something and you know that it works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and you can change it only for you, and you don&#8217;t have to even publish a code for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> The last item I had is just mostly for us when we are going to the changelog is that now those, as I said, some of the experiments that were moved to the stable feature, so that&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t see as many items in that list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think what also was on the list, but we skipped it, is that the changelog automation, when the plugin is released, there is now a process there to look at each automation process to look at each PR and classified at the different categories, and then put it into the block library, so when you read through the release notes, you can better identify what the change actually was about and have some of the changes clustered in one category. I really like that. There&#8217;s some great work to be done there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think that we should see that in two weeks, when the new changelog is generated, because it was too late to use those changes for the release. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it because it will have a better grouping, and that will improve the reading experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That was then the Gutenberg 11.1. Go out and test it and try it and work with it. I don&#8217;t know how many of you use Gutenberg actually in production. I do on many sites. I have yet to have to return to a previous version, but I also know where the pitfalls are that I can work around and say, &#8220;No, that doesn&#8217;t work. Don&#8217;t do it,&#8221; to some of the code editors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That gets us into what&#8217;s an active development and what&#8217;s discussed. Hector Prieto has skipped the What&#8217;s Next focus post that comes out every month for July, for beginning of July because of all the work that was to be done for WordPress 5.8, and everybody was focused on that. He published just also this week the new site editor status check for late July, so for one week, and then for the whole of August, which is the focus project. You had a quote that you found interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah. I reached out to Hector and asked him about the higher-level overview. The main idea is to turn a page after 5.8 from the classic FSA foundational work to a new iteration that focuses apart from remaining things like navigation, on design tools, patterns and all kinds of interactions that improve and ease the user experience as the editor complexity grows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That means that for the site editing infrastructure, there were a few focuses. One is of course the template previewing, making it easier for people to see what they&#8217;re doing. Then the browse mode, that&#8217;s a new mode, I think. Then, mosaic view for theme template. You get cards from the theme template, so you can choose them and you hopefully also see &#8230; I saw some early mock-ups of that where you see some preview of how it looks, how each template looks, so you can select the right one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, restrict the block editing capabilities based on context. That&#8217;s certainly important when you have a block that&#8217;s used on a page or a block that&#8217;s used, for instance, in a block template or a widget setting, and also if it&#8217;s an inner block or an outer block or with a query loop block. I think that comes very much into fruition there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I&#8217;m looking forward to see the browse mode because it essentially allows you to navigate with the links that are on the page, so you can just go from the whole screen and see how it looks like, go to the About page, change something there, go to the contact page, change something there, it will be very smooth experience once this is in action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That sounds almost like a front-end editing, but in the editor. I&#8217;d like to see that, yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Global Styles</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One other part is certainly the global styles. Global styles was always two parts. One was what then became the theme JSON feature where you have a central place for theme developers to have all the settings for a certain theme, and that&#8217;s in a configuration file, but the second part was for user to change global styles with a user interface in the sidebar of the site editor, and has been in experiment I think since last December or November already, but that is now make it ready for more users to test it and get it out of the experiments into the plugin and then make it ready for 5.9 hopefully that will come out in December.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Just to clarify, is it this feature that has its own sidebar presence in the site editor, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> That&#8217;s this section?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s a global style.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski: </em>It probably builds on top of theme JSON, so that only shows the customizations you make to the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. The theme could actually allow you to have multiple color palettes, but then, it gives you that interface to change it up and then react to it. I think it&#8217;s a big, big task to get this right and get it interesting for a user to actually pursue that, but also to not be all things to all people. That&#8217;s a balance to strike there, but yeah, that&#8217;s one of the focus items that Hector Prieto highlighted in his post. I&#8217;m just going to look on &#8230;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has other things as well, one as the theme blocks that have more of the post aid, post excerpt, post feature, post content kind of blocks for the query block, and also the site header, site title and the header thing are already in there, but they of course need to be refined. Then, the query loop block will get some enhancement. Then, another focus is the navigation block and editor screen and site editing gradual adoption, which needs to be seen how can a theme move from a classic theme over a hybrid theme to be a universal theme or a block-based full-site editing theme only. All those interactions are to be discussed and worked on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even more. The whole post is I think about 3,000 words long, but it&#8217;s a milestone to look at that, okay, we know that and what&#8217;s coming up and we are not done yet. We are not there yet and there are quite a few things to be done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think that&#8217;s so big because it more covers the scope of the WordPress 5.9 release, at least what&#8217;s in plans. Rather than something that you can realistically do in August, when people on the north of the globe spend time during summer vacation, so I don&#8217;t expect so much movement in that area, but it&#8217;s great to see the vision for the release, and everyone can just focus on their area of interest and drill down in it later throughout there and get involved in those parts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s really a great way to learn more about the details of all those things that might come for 5.9 or even 6.0, because we will have something like what we had in April, where we go look at all the features or the team is going to look at all the features that, is it ready yet, is it ready yet, or do we punt it for 6.0?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature lead, if such a thing is actually there, Robert Anderson talked about, has an overview issue on GitHub now with what&#8217;s next for the widget editor now that&#8217;s in Core, what are the things to be worked on. That&#8217;s definitely something to look through because it&#8217;s how to smooth out the rough edges, improve performance and stability, and improve extensibility for all the plugin developers out there that now want to extend the widget editor or widget sections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a good overview issue and see what&#8217;s all worked on. Of course, we&#8217;ll share that all in the show notes. What I found was a little bit put on the ways, on the side was the gallery refractor for the gallery block that switches from a &#8230; to have nested image blocks in the gallery rather than create the images over and over, but we haven&#8217;t gone further with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn&#8217;t been merged with the Gutenberg plugin yet. It&#8217;s still out there, but I&#8217;m really excited about it and I have been excited since I started testing it because it has so much more potential and I&#8217;m really looking forward to that. I think I&#8217;m going to go back to that and see if I can assist in some more testing there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think it&#8217;s mostly about the Core compatibility. That&#8217;s the only challenge that is making this process so difficult. That&#8217;s why it takes so long.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, I totally get it. I was not trying to be impatient. I know the last 10% normally take 80% of the time that it takes to build something like that. It would be such a rich experience for a content creator that it&#8217;s worth spending time on and getting it right, of course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> I think everyone is aware that you could now use list view and use drag-and-drop to move your image to the gallery or move out of the gallery and reorder some of the images. There&#8217;s so much potential when you start using those concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Just to apply the image styles, that you have a gallery of head shots that you can make round for a conference or just a little event or so that you have, it&#8217;s just a nice experience, rather than….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Or maybe groups inside the gallery. You could create columns, groups, whatever. It&#8217;s so exciting to think about all the possibilities that it opens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I like that creativity say, &#8220;When we can do that, can we do other things?&#8221; Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty much we&#8217;re on the end of the show. For all those that are on holiday and a vacation and are outside and away from the keyboard and still listening to it, we&#8217;re so happy you&#8217;re here. When you get back to the computer, you have so many great things to test out and work on. Do you have any last announcements or things that you weren&#8217;t able to get in before that, Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> No, no.

The buzz around the next major WordPress version keeps everyone excited and alert. There is also hard to deal with FOMO*, as we can&#8217;t be at two or three places at the same time. And who has time to watch all the recordings? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, next week won&#8217;t be any different: Monday, the <a href=\"https://pagebuildersummit.com/\">Page Builder Summit </a>will start with 35+ talks around freelance and agency business their tools. <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#pagebuilder\">Below is a list </a>of all Gutenberg related talks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress teams published quite a few posts around the WordPress 5.9 release. It&#8217;s not yet Field Guide time, though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope, y&#8217;all have a great weekend with reduced screen time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br />Birgit</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: The recordings of the last two Live Q &amp; As are available on YouTube. The posts with resources and transcript are in the works. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiIhJdFfamA&t=9s\">From Classic Themes to block-based Themes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PZwfvtkQOM&t=10s\">How can we make building custom blocks easier?</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>PPS: In a very short video, <strong>Jamie Marsland</strong> shows us <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvM3kK6l2Y8\">Why WordPress Gutenberg is a threat to Elementor and Divi</a>. #shorts </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">*Fear of Missing Out</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gutenberg and WordPress Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In his post, <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/15/wordpress-5-9-feature-go-no-go-october-14-2021/\">WordPress 5.9 Feature Go/No-Go</a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/priethor\">Hector Prieto</a></strong> published the summary of the meeting, the list of features, the recording, and a transcript. The recording is particularly interesting for Matias Ventura&#8217;s demo of the current state of the major features: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>List View &#8211; Expand-collapse, Drag &amp; Drop</li><li>Auto-Anchors on Headings</li><li>Border support for blocks</li><li>Layout &#8211; Gap spacing, Flex &amp; Row,</li><li>Typography Tools across Blocks and styles </li><li>Full-site Editing as opt-in, beta preview. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the meeting, I heard the language shifting, in an attempt to simplify talking about the various features. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Now: <strong>Block Themes</strong> (instead of Block-based Themes)</li><li>Now: <strong>Editor</strong> (instead of Site Editor or Template Editor)</li><li>Now: <strong>Styles</strong> (instead of Global Styles) </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> wrote about it in the WPTavern:<strong> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward\">WordPress 5.9 Go/No-Go Update: All Proposed Features Are Moving Forward</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The work on WordPress 5.9 is on track with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/13/preliminary-road-to-5-9/\">The Preliminary Road 5.9</a>, Matias Ventura posted a couple month ago, except for the Navigation Screen, that did not get past the backwards compatibility issues. The Navigation Block as a major feature for site-building will be available for Block Themes in the new WordPress version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the status on the Navigation Screen and Block project, the team came together in a Hallway Hangout to discuss the priorities for the WordPress 5.9 release. <strong>Daniel Richards</strong> posted the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/15/summary-navigation-editor-and-block-hallway-hangout/\"><strong>Summary: Navigation Editor and Block hallway hangout</strong></a>, including the recording of the meeting. One meeting topic was Backwards compatibility with the current system for the Navigation screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Gutenberg developers also release a new version of the Gutenberg plugin. <strong>Gutenberg 11.7</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam Zielinski,</strong> release coordinator for this version, published the release notes: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/14/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-7-october-13th/\"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 11.7 (October 13th)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> took it for a spin and reviewed it for the WPTavern: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-7-iterates-on-global-styles-improves-adding-navigation-links-and-adds-column-spacing\"><strong>Gutenberg 11.7 Iterates on Global Styles, Improves Adding Navigation Links, and Adds Column Spacing</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Only two more Gutenberg releases (11.8 + 11.9) until Feature Freeze on November 9th, 2021. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kellychoffman\">Kelly Hoffman</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameskoster\">James Koster</a></strong>  from the WordPress design team shared their ideas for <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/10/15/site-editing-ia-concepts-how-to-surface-and-access-new-features/\">Site editing IA concepts: How to surface and access new features</a></strong>. (IA = Information Architecture) <br />They wrote: &#8220;Do we want to begin down this path towards a single page app-like experience, or would it be better to keep things separate for now? It’s time to explore and design the IA (information architecture) so that we can begin to paint a picture of how we might merge this exciting functionality in to core.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can follow along the explorations via the <em>prototype links</em> on Figma. You are offered two ideas: All in one means one editor screen, reached via the “Appearance” Menu, and you edit templates, post, and pages, template parts or change the styles all on this screen that adjust for the various context.  The other idea is to keep post and page editing and site editing features separate, but surface some template parts to be reachable via the post/page editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Example screen: <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/10/15/site-editing-ia-concepts-how-to-surface-and-access-new-features/\">Site editing IA concepts: How to surface and access new features</a></strong>.\n\n\n\n<p>I can see the all-in-one idea working, as it would hide the rest of the WPAdmin for the common content creation tasks, as that&#8217;s where many end users get lost or bombarded with plugins or theme upsell and update notices. I also enjoy the alternative design to the &#8220;Welcome Guide.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a quick decision to make. As the second one feels familiar, and the first one very new, I suspect my decision might be skewed by the &#8220;known&#8221; versus the &#8220;new&#8221;, instead which of the avenues makes the best sense for the End-User. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you have an opinion formed, leave a comment on the post! </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress 5.9 only two months away and Go-NoGo decisions made,  <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> started a second round of collecting questions you might have about Full-site editing. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/13/submit-full-site-editing-questions-by-oct-27th/\"><strong>Submit Full Site Editing questions by Oct 27th</strong></a>.

So what happens if someone installs Twenty Twenty-Two or another block-based theme? The left admin menu for Customizer isn&rsquo;t there. The janky way to get there is via Appearance &gt; Themes &gt; Customizer. But the expectation is that third-party plugins and themes need to move settings over. In fact, this seems more like they need to duplicate settings in both places for a while.</p><cite>Anonymous</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For those out of the loop, let me provide a quick refresher on this topic. When WordPress 5.9 lands, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward\">we expect it to ship</a> with the new site editor and global styles interface. However, most users will not see this screen unless they are running a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the upcoming <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a> is also shipping with WordPress 5.9 and judging the popularity of past default themes, we can expect many thousands of users will be transported into this whole new world. For some, this might be as shocking as the launch of the block editor in 5.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a block theme is active, links to access the old and familiar customizer will disappear from the user interface. The widgets and nav menu screens won&rsquo;t be around either. However, they will still be accessible if you know the URL for the screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We first learned this would be the case last year as part of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-9-3-provides-indicator-of-where-full-site-editing-is-going-a-future-without-widgets-and-customizer-screens\">Gutenberg 9.3 release</a>. There is also an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/30496\">open issue</a> to ensure that the site editor has feature parity with some core WordPress settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is OK that these features are being phased out for block theme users. They were all early, disparate attempts at creating individual pieces of what the site editor will allow. WordPress is bringing all of these concepts together into a more cohesive user experience. It is a standard that contributors can continually iterate on. It will not be perfect out of the gate, but this first version in the core platform should fuel the feedback needed to improve it as more users start installing block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem presented here has more to do with the plugin market. The customizer was initially built as a theme-settings tool and has primarily been used for that purpose. But, many plugins have tied various settings to it over its nine-year history. A search for <a href=\"https://wpdirectory.net/search/01FJ2TGB2EZ4N867KXEA6TS6CJ\"><code>wp_customize</code></a> in the plugin directory pulls up over 1,400 results. The <a href=\"https://wpdirectory.net/search/01FJ34ZYJZTJ5MGNW4J82FBV4Z\"><code>customize_register</code></a> hook shows over 1,900. These are not necessarily exact matches for how many plugins actually add panels, sections, settings, or controls. However, it is an indicator that many are relying on it to present options to end-users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we are back to the question at hand. <em>What happens when a user installs a block theme, such as the upcoming Twenty Twenty-Two, while using a plugin that relies on the customizer?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some plugins like WooCommerce have already conveniently placed a direct link to their customizer panel/section in the admin menu. This will be a non-issue for their users. However, for everyone else, the customizer will seem to disappear entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />WooCommerce customizer options accessible with block theme.\n\n\n\n<p>In a matter of weeks after 5.9, depending on how quick the adoption of Twenty Twenty-Two occurs in particular, we could be looking at thousands of confused users. Of course, all of this could change in the time leading up to the release. However, this is a conversation that needs to happen now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The concern here is for end-users,&rdquo; said the anonymous questioner. &ldquo;They will be looking at knowledgebase articles, directions in plugin settings, and more indicating where to look for the settings.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least at the moment, the onus is on plugin authors to address this for their own users. However, there are multiple pathways they may want to go down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most straightforward method is to follow the lead of WooCommerce. The plugin checks the <code>gutenberg_is_fse_theme()</code> conditional (note that this <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32950\">function name may change</a>). If it returns <code>true</code>, the plugin adds a link directly to its customizer panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking to a customizer panel, section, or control is simple. Plugin authors can find the URLs in the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/the-customizer-javascript-api/#focusing-ui-objects\">developer handbook</a>. They can also just <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/2cf30b0190542ed097d0f2e9a607db10561d43e8/includes/customizer/class-wc-shop-customizer.php#L274-L289\">copy the technique</a> the WooCommerce team employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a quick method to ensure users do not lose access to their options if plugin authors cannot make changes before WordPress 5.9 lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, it is not the ideal solution. The customizer will be around for a long while, but plugin authors will need to deal with two sets of users: those running both block and classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because each plugin is different, solutions will need to be different. Many can simply use the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/settings-api/\">Settings API</a> to build a custom options screen. If that is a workable solution, it will not matter what theme the user is running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the reality might be maintaining two systems for both sets of users. One that integrates with the customizer and another that pulls options into the site editor. If the plugin has design-related features, block theme users will expect to see settings in the new interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the theming side of things, there should be fewer problems. A block theme does nothing with the customizer anyway. One outstanding issue would be converting starter content over, and there is an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35680\">open ticket</a> to bring that to Full Site Editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than anything, keeping open lines of communication with users will help ease the transition. Some of that should come from core WordPress. However, many users will need to hear it from their plugin and theme developers. This might be blog posts, knowledgebase or tutorial updates, and keeping up with support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, there is the final solution, one that WordPress itself could implement. It is also the path of least resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress should automatically detect filters or actions on customizer-related hooks. This should trigger a &ldquo;customize supports&rdquo; flag and maintain the admin menu and toolbar links to the customizer screen. This would give developers some time to catch up without confusing users in the process. There might be a few false flags or missed integrations, but it should be able to effectively catch the majority of use cases.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 16 Oct 2021 01:02:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.9 Go/No-Go Update: All Proposed Features Are Moving Forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:205:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-9-go-no-go-update-all-proposed-features-are-moving-forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2859:\"<p>The go/no-go deadline for deciding on features for WordPress 5.9 was set for October 12 but the conversation was pushed back two days. Today, the core leadership for this release <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/15/wordpress-5-9-feature-go-no-go-october-14-2021/\">announced</a> that everything in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-proposed-scope-major-push-towards-full-site-editing-plus-a-new-default-theme\">previously-proposed scope for 5.9</a> will be moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can expect block themes, template and template part editing flows, the new default Twenty-Twenty Two block theme, the Styles interface, design tools, the Navigation Block, all manner of UI improvements, and pattern insertion directly from the Pattern Directory. H&eacute;ctor Prieto, who is assisting with technical project management on the release, emphasized that many of these features are still in progress:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>To note, not all of the above are currently ready, but there is some level of confidence that they can be by the time of 5.9.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/62\">WordPress 5.9 Must-Haves</a> project board on GitHub shows a broad overview of the issues contributors are focusing on to get the release ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prieto also published an exhaustive transcript of the meeting. There were no strong objections on specific features moving forward but there seemed to be a general acknowledgment that some features are still in a beta state. Those present at the meeting agreed that some kind of beta label might be advantageous where users could be directed to the Gutenberg plugin for faster updates to features that are still not fully polished. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One particularly challenging feature has been navigation. &ldquo;I think from my perspective, the thing I was a bit worried about was the&nbsp;navigation menu&nbsp;flows, which I think we did a lot of progress over the last few weeks,&rdquo; Gutenberg lead engineer Mat&iacute;as Ventura said. &ldquo;And I think we need to set some good boundaries there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There has been a lot of work in also supporting sort of mega menus where you have in your sub-menus, you have images and paragraph any sort of block, which is cool. But there&rsquo;s also like the 80% of cases where you just have a few links, and we need to ensure that that experience is as best as we can make it. I think we&rsquo;re in a better place. And I think we&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta 1 is expected November 16, and the official release is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/\">scheduled</a> for December 14.

The Global Styles system iterations continue to impress. The lighter nav experience makes adding links easier, and a spacing control for the Columns block delivered one of my oldest wish list items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Logo block <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35344\">supports duotone filters</a>, bringing it up to par with other image-related blocks. Plus, theme authors can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34667\">set the default filter</a> via their <code>theme.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several other changes to love, such as the refreshed <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34712\">gradient picker design</a> and typography controls for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35324\">post navigation blocks</a>. The block alignment control in the toolbar now also displays a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34710\">&ldquo;None&rdquo; option</a>. This should make it easier for users to revert from a previous choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lighter Navigation Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />&ldquo;Add nav item&rdquo; feature brings up search.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Building nav menus has consistently been one of the frustrating experiences within the block system. Iterative improvements have made it better, but the actual process of adding links has been a painful one, at least until Gutenberg 11.7 rolled out yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous iterations of the block, users had to go through a two-step process for adding any menu item. This was an issue I called out in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-9-building-a-higher-ed-header\">Round #9 of the FSE Outreach Program</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This stage of testing calls for adding multiple page links as both top-level and sub-menu items. When clicking the + button to add a link, my first instinct is to search for the page itself. However, the available field is a block search rather than a page search.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest version of the plugin, clicking the <code>+</code> icon allows users to directly search for or type a URL. There is no need to figure out which block (e.g., Page, Post, Custom, etc.) to insert first. This change is part of an ongoing effort to create a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34041\">lighter navigation experience</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the link-adding experience was much better, I could not initially figure out how to add a simple homepage link without typing the full URL. Typing &ldquo;home,&rdquo; &ldquo;index,&rdquo; or a simple &ldquo;/&rdquo; character all failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After realizing that the previous search did not work, I tried other known site pages. Posts, pages, categories, and tags all worked without issue. However, I could not pull up author/user archive URLs through the search field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one place to add a homepage link, and that is via transforming the menu item to a Home Link block by clicking on its icon in the toolbar. Other blocks are also available for this transformation process, such as Social Icons, Site Logo, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Transforming a link to a &ldquo;Home Link&rdquo; block.\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, this is a much-needed improvement to the Navigation block&rsquo;s user experience. It likely comes closer to hitting the 80/20 rule when deciding how a feature should be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Create New Pages From the Link Inserter</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a new page from the link popover.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The user experience for adding links has been one of the highlights of the block editor this year. In June, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-9-renames-the-query-block-adds-collapsible-list-view-items-and-rolls-out-rich-url-previews\">Gutenberg 10.9</a> introduced rich URL previews, which landed in WordPress 5.8. In the latest release of the plugin, developers have kicked it up a notch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can now directly <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35083\">create new pages when adding links</a>. Previously, users could only achieve this feat while adding items inside of the Navigation block. Now, it is available for links added anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mind the Gap</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom spacing between columns.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users can now entirely control the gap between columns via the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34630\">Block Spacing option</a>. I knew it was coming &mdash; eventually. That it took three years since the release of the block editor for it to actually happen has been painful. I was still a full-time theme and plugin developer when I added this to my wish list. Granted, CSS flexbox support for <code>gap</code> was not widespread then, but we could have still managed with old-fashioned margins in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am just happy that the long-awaited feature has finally landed. Now, I can begin phasing out the custom block styles I was using to replicate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature works on top of the block gap feature that was first shipped with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-4-overhauls-galleries-adds-axial-padding-for-buttons-and-lays-groundwork-for-global-spacing\">Gutenberg 11.4</a>. Theme authors may need to make adjustments if they have written custom code for controlling the spacing between columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Styles and Color Palettes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There is a push to improve the upcoming Global Styles feature, which <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-proposed-scope-major-push-towards-full-site-editing-plus-a-new-default-theme\">could land in WordPress 5.9</a> later this year. Gutenberg contributors have made massive strides in improving the experience, building off its overhauled navigation in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-6-improves-the-global-styles-ui-adds-child-theme-support\">version 11.6</a> of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable interface change in this release is the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35109\">Color Palette section</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Colors panel with the Palette section at the top.\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of dropping the palette below the color options, it is now front and center. This is a feature that will ultimately empower users to customize their sites. The decision to focus on this part of the UI is welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After opening the palette section, users can edit the theme-defined colors or click the <code>+</code> icon to create new ones. These colors will all show up as options in the block and site editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Color palette editor in the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>Users should also see the Layout section at the root level of the Global Styles sidebar. They can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35241\">adjust the padding</a> for the overall site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am still running into an error when trying to adjust the typography at the root level. This was an issue I first noticed with Gutenberg 11.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like the Blocks section of the Global Styles panel to show the icons for individual blocks. With dozens of blocks, it is hard to scan through the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Individual block styles list.\n\n\n\n<p>Another improvement, particularly if we forego icons, would be to alphabetize the list.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 20:52:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Yoast and Google-Sponsored Core Contributors Propose New WordPress Performance Team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124218\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:231:\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-and-google-sponsored-core-contributors-propose-new-wordpress-performance-team?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=yoast-and-google-sponsored-core-contributors-propose-new-wordpress-performance-team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7043:\"<p>Yoast and Google-sponsored WordPress core contributors are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/12/proposal-for-a-performance-team/\">proposing</a> the project add a Performance team to improve core performance as measured by <a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\">Google&rsquo;s Web Vitals</a> metrics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Users expect and prefer fast experiences (consciously or otherwise),&rdquo; Yoast-sponsored full-time core contributor Ari Stathopoulos said. &ldquo;Research shows that fast websites can provide a better user experience, increase engagement, benefit SEO, increase conversion, and be more economically and ecologically friendly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that users expect and can benefit from improved performance, but there are a number of variables at play in any given WordPress site. Looking purely at core performance, Stathopoulos said WordPress is not holding up to the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Compared to other platforms (e.g., Wix, Shopify, Squarespace), WordPress is falling behind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Other platforms are on average faster &ndash; and becoming increasingly faster &ndash; than WordPress websites (see&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/55bc8fad-44c2-4280-aa0b-5f3f0cd3d2be/page/M6ZPC?params=%7B%22df44%22:%22include%25EE%2580%25800%25EE%2580%2580IN%25EE%2580%2580WordPress%25EE%2580%2580WooCommerce%25EE%2580%2580Shopify%25EE%2580%2580Wix%25EE%2580%2580Squarespace%25EE%2580%2580Duda%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">The HTTP Archive&rsquo;s Core Web Vitals report</a>), and are actively investing in (and marketing)&nbsp;core&nbsp;performance-as-a-feature [<a href=\"https://twitter.com/igrigorik/status/1432400252305244162\">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.wix.com/en/article/understanding-your-site-speed-dashboard\">2</a>].&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HTTP Archive, which&nbsp;provides a common data set for those conducting web performance research, found that only 21.5% of sites assessed have good Core Web Vitals scores as of September 2021. While that percentage has been increasing over time, competitors that are already outperforming WordPress sites are also rapidly improving their scores. Stathopoulos described it as a &ldquo;widening gap&rdquo; between WordPress and other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main challenges is that WordPress site owners have a lot of freedom to use whatever themes and plugins they want on their sites, which makes performance tougher to tackle than the hosted platforms cited for comparison. The proposal states that &ldquo;achieving reasonable performance levels shouldn&rsquo;t be plugin territory, but part of core&rdquo; and that end-users should not be expected to become performance experts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Achieving high levels of performance requires technical considerations to be &lsquo;built-in&rsquo; across the whole stack; and as this is often not the case with themes/plugins, performance solutions are limited to &lsquo;brute-forcing&rsquo; performance solutions over non-performant behavior (e.g., output buffering),&rdquo; Stathopoulos said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal drew a strong response from contributors, SEO consultants, and representatives from hosting companies, offering help and suggestions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress lead developer Mark Jaquith, who has a particular interest in this topic, said the biggest issues he sees today are related to frontend performance and the asset pipeline:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>WordPress has no (direct) support for deferring style loading. It has no system for critical theme styles. For&nbsp;JavaScript, it has no support for&nbsp;<code>defer</code>,&nbsp;<code>async</code>,&nbsp;<code>type=\"module\"</code>, or&nbsp;<code>nomodule</code>. The default is to load all scripts in the&nbsp;header. WordPress itself shoves its extra code for emoji and the&nbsp;block&nbsp;library into the header. WordPress injects&nbsp;JS&nbsp;code and styles that eschew the asset pipeline altogether and directly attach to&nbsp;<code>wp_head</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>wp_footer</code>. Plugins just directly barf out bespoke script tags that are difficult to alter. By the time that you&rsquo;ve added 10 plugins to your site, your odds of having jQuery loaded (in the header) on every single page load are extremely high. No one is incentivized to be a good citizen (including WordPress itself) because there&rsquo;s always someone else who is polluting worse than you. &ldquo;If jQuery is already enqueued by something else, I guess I better use it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaquith&rsquo;s summary describes a wider ecosystem problem and concluded with a sobering warning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge problem, and fixing it is going to take a lot of effort, willpower and time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth doing. If WordPress frontend performance continues to decline, the project is going to cease to be a viable option for any site that cares about its SERPS.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One WordPress performance consultant, Eroan Boyer, suggested adding a dedicated tool in the Site Health screen that would show how much JS and CSS is loaded on each page type (front page, post, page, CPT), and where they originated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Attributing where a given script or stylesheet comes from is something I&rsquo;ve been working a lot on in the context of the AMP&nbsp;plugin,&rdquo; Google Engineer Weston Ruter said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if the implementation in the AMP plugin would be suitable for&nbsp;core, but I&rsquo;m interested in this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If we can correlate where given markup comes from to the (negative) impact on page performance, then we can begin to highlight offending themes and plugins to begin to provide some accountability for what is being added to the frontend.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella published some research in August on <a href=\"https://riad.blog/2021/08/16/the-cost-of-wordpress-plugins-on-the-performance-of-the-editor/\">the impact of plugins&rsquo; performance on the editor</a>. Chief offenders among popular plugins included WooCommerce, Yoast SEO, and Jetpack. This is another aspect of performance that affects WordPress users more than site visitors. Web developer Takis Bouyouris <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/12/proposal-for-a-performance-team/#comment-41989\">suggested</a> the creation of a performance framework that plugin developers could follow to avoid making products that negatively impact core performance, both on the frontend and in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the proposal has not received any major objections and contributors seem eager to help in any way they can. Stathopoulos said the next steps will be to set up a Slack channel, a meeting schedule, and a space on make.wordpress.org. Once the infrastructure is in place, contributors can begin benchmarking performance, defining success criteria, and identifying priority projects for Core Web Vitals improvements.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:24:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Take the Guesswork Out of Selecting Fonts With the Adrian WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123897\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:213:\"https://wptavern.com/take-the-guesswork-out-of-selecting-fonts-with-the-adrian-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=take-the-guesswork-out-of-selecting-fonts-with-the-adrian-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5893:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As usual, I am always on the lookout for plugins that allow users to have fun with their websites. I like to mix it up from time to time here on the Tavern and not be all-business-all-the-time. And, that is where the new <a href=\"https://adrian.style/\">Adrian plugin</a> comes in. Its goal is to take all of the hard work out of selecting a font pairing for end-users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin derives its name from Swiss typeface designer Adrian Johann Frutiger. The plugin author, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the typographer was one of their favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All plugins have such serious names stuffed with SEO keywords, and I just wanted something fun,&rdquo; they added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of the typical route of submitting it to the WordPress.org directory, the author decided to launch a one-off site to showcase the plugin. The cost runs the price of simply subscribing to an email list to access the download.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adrian is essentially a font selector. However, instead of picking each font for various theme elements, users can select from curated pairings. And, taking it one step more, it provides unique names for all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the Breakfast Cereal (yes, that is the actual name) option uses the big and bold Luckiest Guy font for headings alongside News Cycle for body copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Breakfast Cereal font option.\n\n\n\n<p>If nothing else, the plugin is simply a treat to test because of its fun names. With options like Cherry Soda, Cowboy, and Hollywood Lights, it adds a little flavor to the entire process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think there are lots of people who would rather you hand them an option rather the ability to make the decisions themselves,&rdquo; said the plugin author. &ldquo;No one in their right mind looks at the 1.2K fonts in Google Fonts and says, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to pick a font pairing.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s overwhelming and out of most people&rsquo;s depth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as a former full-time theme designer, this could be a tedious job. I would often spend hours tinkering with pairings, attempting to find the right personality for a design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin takes most of that work and boils it down to a little more than three dozen options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a little something for everyone. For example, if you want a retro gaming feel, the Insert Coin pairing of the pixelated Press Start 2P font for headings and Roboto Mono for text can bring a little nostalgia to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Insert Coin retro-gaming font pairing.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is built on top of the WordPress customizer. It adds a single section and control for selecting the font pairing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A downside to this might be for users currently running a block theme alongside the Gutenberg plugin. Menu links to access the customizer screen are hidden. However, there is still a button on the Themes admin screen, at least for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customize button for the active theme.\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I like about the plugin is that it does not ruin body copy. Far too often, such systems try to get too fancy with text for longer-form content, and they utterly fail. Instead, Adrian keeps this in check. The fonts that veer into the wilder territory are limited to headings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is not all fun and games. It has its serious side too. The World Literature option that pairs Vollkorn and PT Serif is elegant, creating an enjoyable reading experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />World Literature font pairing.\n\n\n\n<p>The Novella option is similar, replacing Vollkorn with EB Garamond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most irritating thing about the plugin is that it requires a full refresh of the customizer preview panel each time the user selects a new font. This is par for the course, though. Most themes and plugins I have tested for WordPress have never utilized the customizer to its fullest potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With minimal JavaScript and the <a href=\"https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader\">Web Font Loader script</a>, the plugin could load the chosen font on the fly. It would make the experience much smoother. However, because the customizer is going the way of the dinosaur, I would use my time and effort to focus on a solution geared toward Full Site Editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success may vary from theme to theme. Typically, I use a three-font system with most of my theme design work. One font family for headings, one for body copy, and another for secondary text. While the plugin worked well enough to overrule the first two, it failed to alter the third. This is not necessarily Adrian&rsquo;s fault because it does not know the class name it must target in this instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also the reason I favor design-related features falling squarely on the shoulders of theme authors. I like the forward-thinking of the plugin author &mdash; tackling font decisions in a way that does not overload end-users with seemingly infinite choices. However, I would rather see the system coming from the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, I could be singing a different tune as the global styles system matures. It has not yet shipped with WordPress, but it could land in version 5.9 later this year for block theme users. As the community builds more standards around the feature, there may be more opportunities for plugins like Adrian to add features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin author is not quite ready to go that route yet. &ldquo;I imagine that this can be ported pretty easily to the new FSE interface if I happen to get enough users to keep it going,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Finding someone who knows the new system and is a freelancer is next to impossible, so I thought why not test the idea the old way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the plugin does its job pretty well, and most users still rely on the customizer. There is still plenty of time to figure out the rest.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:14:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: WordPress Global Community Sponsorship Program Will Not Include WordCamps for 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:209:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-global-sponsorship-program-will-not-include-wordcamps-for-2022?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-global-sponsorship-program-will-not-include-wordcamps-for-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4603:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/10/08/proposal-2022-global-community-sponsorship-program/\">proposal</a> for the 2022 Global Community Sponsorship program will not include funding for WordCamps again this year, due to the unpredictability of hosting in-person events. The pandemic continues to make conditions unfavorable in many areas of the world where WordCamp and meetup organizers have opted to continue with virtual events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the Global Community Sponsorship program has offered multiple tiers of funding in support of official, volunteer-organized WordPress community events. In 2020, before the program was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/moving-forward-with-online-events/\">suspended</a>, global sponsorship tiers ranged from $40,000 &ndash; $160,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated proposal knocks sponsorships back to a single annual package, billed at $10,000 USD per quarter. Sponsor benefits are similar to those offered in 2021. While the base package does not include WordCamp sponsorship, program participants can offer it by electing to pay an add-on, which is also billed quarterly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The proposed change for 2022 is that Global Sponsors who add on sponsorship for WordCamps will support&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;WordCamps (as opposed to choosing which WordCamps to sponsor a la carte), at the camp&rsquo;s top published level,&rdquo; WordPress.org community organizer Courtney Patubo Kranzke said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In short, there would not be a community grant as we&rsquo;ve had in the past, but WordCamps will get credited global sponsorship funds at the top local level.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patubo Kranzke said that volunteer engagement is currently low and the single package ensures sponsors have a centralized point of contact, as opposed to trying to coordinate with multiple teams of volunteer event organizers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the potential availability of add-on funds, the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/09/13/announcement-updated-guidelines-for-in-person-wordcamps/\">updated guidelines for in-person WordCamps</a> state that organizers must be prepared to raise 100% of the expenses for their events. They are encouraged to keep their camps&rsquo; budgets lean with free or low cost venues that are fully refundable just in case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The expectation is in-person camps have to be able to cover all costs,&rdquo; Community team contributor Kevin Cristiano said. &ldquo;The global program will bring some relief to local organizers, but more so create a safety net for the entire program. What do I mean a safety net? We are navigating a world with risks on events like never before and we simply cannot afford another round of cancellations and lost deposits. It is our hope that once finalized the Global program can help bring stability and mitigate risks so we can have WordCamps begin in person again while being financially responsible.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress community events have been cut back significantly over the past two years. In 2019, local communities hosted 140 WordCamps and 805 WordPress meetup groups met more than 5,900 times. After the pandemic hit in 2020, the community hosted 31 WordCamps, most of which were held online. Meetup groups fell to 745 and met over 4,900 times. At the time of publishing in 2021, there have been just 14 WordCamps (all online) and 755 meetup groups met 2,400+ times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the community team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-opens-applications-for-in-person-wordcamps\">re-opening applications for in-person WordCamps,</a> all the remaining WordCamps on the books for 2021 have been scheduled as online events. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In anticipation of returning to in-person events, WordPress Community Support has added a &ldquo;communicable disease liability coverage&rdquo; policy to its event insurance. Any in-person WordCamp that proceeds to the ticketing stage will have <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/10/11/legal-protections-for-organizers/\">a disclaimer on the purchase page</a>, aimed at protecting organizers against claims related to COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/10/08/proposal-2022-global-community-sponsorship-program/\">proposal</a> for the 2022 Global Community Sponsorship program is still under discussion until October 15, and will be finalized by October 28, so WordPress can recruit sponsors by the end of the year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 03:10:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Dynamic Social Images for Plugins, Themes, and Patterns?

You get mere seconds to impress those who happen upon your posts promoting your latest project. You must also pack a lot of information into a small window that would potentially draw in an array of different users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has not been doing any favors for plugin and theme authors who share links to their directory-hosted extensions. Social cards for them include a simple image, title, and description. Instead, WordPress.org could dynamically generate the social images by populating them with other data, such as ratings, active installs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is just what GiveWP co-founder Matt Cromwell <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5926\">proposed today in a new ticket</a>. &ldquo;When plugin/theme/block/pattern authors want to share their work on social platforms, they want to link directly to their product on .org and have it look nice,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He shared an image of an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GiveWP/status/1447964733747908622\">earlier tweet</a> from the GiveWP Twitter account today:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to piggyback off the concept that GitHub put in motion over the summer. In June, the platform launched a new <a href=\"https://github.blog/2021-06-22-framework-building-open-graph-images/\">framework for building Open Graph images</a>. The system generates an on-the-fly image with data specific to a repository, issue, pull request, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of WordPress plugins, themes, and patterns, there are bits of information that could help highlight the projects:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Contributors (plugins only)</li><li>Locales/Translations</li><li>Rating</li><li>Installs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This data is readily available on WordPress.org. All that would really be required is the code for generating the social images with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cromwell shared a mockup of what this might look like for a plugin, which is also available through the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/ZAggnVZ5bk0W27ihzQGdWt/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1\">Figma project</a> he created:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Mockup for a plugin&rsquo;s generated social image.\n\n\n\n<p>He also has an annotated version:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Annotated version of social image mockup.\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, the feedback has been positive in the ticket. This is probably one of those easy wins that most people in the community could get behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d only add that I&rsquo;d love this to be automatically translated,&rdquo; said Jean-Baptiste Audras <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5926#comment:4\">in the ticket</a>. &ldquo;Which seems doable given the language/locale is provided by the URL.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to use the translated text for the generated image if the shared link is from one of the many locale-specific subdomains on WordPress.org. So, a Spanish URL would use the existing Spanish translation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could even apply this concept to other pages on WordPress.org, particularly those that might not have an image associated with them. This is a treatment that Courtney Engle Robertson, Web Design and Developer Advocate at GoDaddy, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mathetos/posts/10223954958280286?comment_id=10223955011961628\">requested on Cromwell&rsquo;s Facebook post</a> about the idea. Workshops on the Learn section of the site, for example, could display the number of languages or length, so potential visitors have more information before clicking a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing about this idea is that the WordPress community likely already has the foundational code to make this happen. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-social-image-generator-plugin-plans-to-integrate-with-jetpack\">Automattic purchased</a> Daniel Post&rsquo;s Social Image Generator plugin last month. The plan is to bundle the feature in Jetpack as part of its social media tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Generated image using dynamic data.\n\n\n\n<p>With a bit of custom code, it is not a stretch to think we could have better social images in short order. The plugin was already built with customization in mind when I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/create-per-post-social-media-images-with-the-social-image-generator-wordpress-plugin\">reviewed it in June</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 23:52:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Profiles Now Show Activity for Contributions Made on GitHub\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=124100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-profiles-now-show-activity-for-contributions-made-on-github?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-org-profiles-now-show-activity-for-contributions-made-on-github\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3263:\"<p>WordPress.org profiles got an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2021/10/11/wordpress-org-profiles-now-show-github-activity/\">update</a> over the weekend that will make them a better reflection of contributors&rsquo; efforts on GitHub.

Early adopters who linked their accounts when the feature was first being tested may need to re-authenticate since the earlier version had <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/05/03/expired-github-and-wordpress-org-profile-connections/\">expired connections</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking accounts will help make it easier for the WordPress project to track contributions across multiple locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In recent releases, the process of collecting props for non-WordPress.org contributions (namely&nbsp;Gutenberg) has been highly manual and error prone, occasionally resulting in contributors not receiving proper credit,&rdquo; Jonathan Desrosiers said when rolling out the first version of the app in March 2020. &ldquo;Connecting your WordPress.org and GitHub accounts will allow automatic tooling to be built which reduces the burden on release teams to maintain a credit list.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who want to have their profiles include GitHub activity can navigate to the <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/profile/edit/group/1\">Edit Profile page on WordPress.org</a>, launch the app, and authorize their accounts with one click. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse is collecting feedback regarding adding more events (i.e. commenting on issues/PRs), combining events (i.e. Submitted &amp; Merged), and anything else that might improve the quality of activity tracked. Riad Benguella suggested adding a selector to filter the timeline by activity type. Hulse responded that the way profiles are currently set up, querying specific activities cannot currently be done in a performant way but that there are meta trac tickets (<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/479\">#479</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/518\">#518</a>) where they are discussing a broader overhaul for profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a great deal more activity coming in from GitHub, the ability to filter these activities might make WordPress.org a more comprehensive tool for assessing job candidates or verifying Five for the Future contributions.

That is the question that some will likely need to answer in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, submissions are not open for the block pattern directory. However, that will change as the contributors eventually wrap up the pattern creation process. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/milestone/3\">The milestone</a> for this is set to October 15, but it is sitting at 25% completion at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 146 themes in the directory with block patterns. Thus far, developers who have wanted to implement them have had no other choice but to bundle them. However, that may all change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core contributor Kjell Reigstad recently <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/35364\">proposed an alternative method</a>. &ldquo;With the launch of the pattern directory (and the upcoming ability for folks to submit their own patterns to it), we should consider building a route through which themes can highlight specific patterns to their users,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigstad proposed using the standard <code>theme.json</code> file to allow theme authors to surface or give special attention to patterns best suited to the theme&rsquo;s design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He listed four primary benefits such a system would bring:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It would cut back on theme code, creating a side benefit of simplifying the review process for the Themes Team.</li><li>Patterns could be updated, tested, and reviewed separately.</li><li>More patterns would be accessible for all users if theme authors jumped on board.</li><li>Multiple themes could make use of the same patterns, reducing redundancy in the pattern directory.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea would be an additional step to this sort of utopian future where users can mix and match various elements and have them <em>just work</em> with whatever theme they are using. I am excited about it, but we still have a long way to go. When all of the core blocks support a full suite of design options, this will be far easier to accomplish, particularly when it comes to layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is built on the premise that themes have begun to create their own <em>de facto</em> standard of putting all of their patterns into a single category titled &ldquo;Theme Name.&rdquo; This is the part where the concept breaks down. The truth is that not many themes are bundling dozens of patterns yet, but I have no doubts that they will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tove, a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tove-a-block-based-wordpress-theme-by-anders-noren\">recently-released block theme</a> by Anders Nor&eacute;n, includes over 40 patterns under seven custom categories. If the developer had put all of them into a single group, it would have been a poor user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Tove patterns and categories.\n\n\n\n<p>I expect dozens of patterns will be common as they become a more vital piece of the theme development experience. If we build a system that encourages themers to highlight those from .ORG, it should be created with that reality in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigstad did mention another idea that might work better if themes are highlighting dozens of patterns. He proposed bubbling them to the top of the list and giving them a special badge of some sort. This method would keep theme authors from overfilling the &ldquo;theme category&rdquo; with dozens or hundreds of patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If democratizing the site design process is the ultimate goal, this feature should help further it. The more pathways we can enable for end-users to build the sites they want, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no reason for every theme to bundle a custom-made hero banner with a heading, paragraph, and button. Narrowing that down to a set of options that work everywhere gives users more power. They might also not feel locked out of a favored design element if they switch themes down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would give theme developers more flexibility too. When someone else has already created several of the patterns they wanted to bundle, they can simply highlight them and not write any code to, essentially, make them a part of the theme itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest holdup for patterns is the existing interface for finding and inserting them. The experience is sub-par at best when you move beyond a couple of dozen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am still in favor of an overlay with tiled patterns that are easily explorable. An earlier concept by Shaun Andrews was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35006#issuecomment-929605688\">shared in a recent draft ticket</a> for a new patterns explorer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Potential block patterns overlay.\n\n\n\n<p>When we get an interface that is fleshed out like this, other ideas around patterns should feel like a natural part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will likely always be a place for developers to build and bundle their own patterns. Some make use of specific styles or other design elements that are only present within the theme itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, I am looking forward to a time when I can mix and match patterns from different community designers on a single site.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 23:48:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"Gutenberg Times: How can we make building blocks easier,  New 2022 Theme, Persistent User preferences and more – Weekend Edition 188\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=19226\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:138:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/how-can-we-make-building-blocks-easier-new-2022-theme-presistent-user-preferences-and-more-weekend-edition-188/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18850:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am so thrilled that I now have more time to work on community outreach, organize Live Q &amp; As and learn more about Gutenberg development.

Dwyer also stipulates, that Universal Themes are a temporary measure, as their need will diminish with Site Editor&#8217;s improvements further down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kjell Reigstad</strong> just <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/06/introducing-twenty-twenty-two/\">introduced the new Twenty-Twenty-Two</a></strong> theme. It&#8217;s bird themed, and I truly loved the backstory of this inspiration. Reigstad tells the story that an array of birds joined his family every morning for breakfast at their bird feeder, and the theme is a mediation over what he saw. My husband and I had a similar breakfast with wildlife experience. Our birds were a bit larger: a white duck, herons, ibises, and Limpkins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme will be a pure block-based theme geared towards the Full-site editing with difference color palettes exposed to the Global Styles interface and interesting block-patterns. In the post, the images are mock-ups. The Themes still needs to be built.

The project is a WordPress-native replacement for SaaS services like Cloudways, Ploi, SpinupWP, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers still need to hook up to a cloud server provider, such as Digital Ocean, Linode, AWS, or elsewhere. However, the project seeks to cut out the middleman for developers and agencies running multiple sites. They are specifically targeting those who would routinely manage 20 or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a true plugin where everything you need runs on your own site (except, of course, the other servers you are provisioning and managing which reside at their respective cloud server providers),&rdquo; said WPCloudDeploy owner Nigel Bahadur.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Server list screen.\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, WPCloudDeploy opened to the public in March 2020, but Bahadur was not ready to aggressively start letting the community know about it. He said the team is now at a point where they have a core group of users who are happy with the plugin. They have been rolling out new functionality every month for a year and a half and feel like it goes above and beyond alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We were basically in stealth mode for most of that time &mdash; we did enough marketing to get a core group of users and then tried to make those users happy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We even offered a heavily discounted lifetime license last year during the Black Friday sales period &ndash;- the folks that purchased then are very happy right now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a mature project, it is time to branch out into the larger WordPress developer and agency market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin promises its customers that they can deploy unlimited WordPress-optimized servers and sites to any cloud or bare-metal server. It has direct integration with 10 of the most popular cloud server providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Server status and overview screen.\n\n\n\n<p>However, provider integration is limited to which <a href=\"https://wpclouddeploy.com/pricing/\">pricing plan</a> the customer decides on. The core tier, which costs $199 per year, only works with Digital Ocean. The business tier runs $499 and adds Linode, Vultr, and UpCloud to the mix. For the full range of providers, customers must upgrade to the all-access plan for $799. Both of the top tiers also have a lifetime purchase option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each tier of the plan is not merely limited to integration with more providers. For example, agencies can sell site and server subscriptions via WooCommerce through the business or all-access packages. White label and teams features are available at all levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Selling Subscriptions through WooCommerce</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WPCloudDeploy allows agencies to sell subscriptions to cloud servers or WordPress sites through WooCommerce. Because of the feature&rsquo;s recent interest, Bahadur said it will likely be a focus area next year for more enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For servers, you can create subscription products where the user gets to choose the provider and location,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Or you can create them where each product represents a single provider (useful if you want to price your AWS servers differently from your DigitalOcean servers).&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have their own separate service that builds on top of this called <a href=\"https://wpcloudpanel.com/\">WPCloudPanel</a>. The team created it with Beaver Builder, WooCommerce, WooCommerce Subscriptions, and Ninja Tables. The entire site required no additional custom code.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />WooCommerce-integrated sales page.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For sites, you can create subscriptions where the site is automatically placed on a particular server in a particular region,&rdquo; said Bahadur. &ldquo;Or you can create them where the site is placed on any available server from an admin-defined list of servers. It&rsquo;s a great way to get a highly customizable end-user purchasing experience using a toolset you already know.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers and agencies are not necessarily limited to WooCommerce. Instead, they can take the team&rsquo;s code and port it to other eCommerce or membership plugins. One such customer is currently working on a MemberPress solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Since the WPCloudDeploy code is just hooking into various WooCommerce actions and filters, it&rsquo;s basically just finding a similar hook in their favorite membership plugin, copying the relevant parts of our WooCommerce integration code, and then ripping out and replacing the WooCommerce-specific function calls,&rdquo; said Bahadur.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From Inception to the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Bahadur said his team started the project to meet their own needs. &ldquo;We really liked the idea of being able to use our own servers for WordPress sites. But at the time, there were still a lot of security questions and other usability and support issues that we were running into from the usual pool of SaaS providers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then decided that his team would build something themselves. Jokingly, he said he completely underestimated the project and how far he would take it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that, back in 2019, I looked too far beyond the WP ecosystem because what I wanted was WP-specific functionality,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cloudways was one of a number of providers I was using at the time, and they offered other services beyond WP. But the overall concept was the same whether it was WP or a server that was suitable for another ecosystem. I think I looked at every WP option there was at the time, including command-line services like WordOps.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said he was not necessarily sure it was important to have such a project in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think what is important is to constantly remind folks of how much WordPress can do, how powerful it is, and to keep battling against the perception that WordPress is less secure than other options,&rdquo; said Bahadur. &ldquo;If you can use a WordPress plugin to run and manage all your servers and sites and/or even act as a hosting service, then we&rsquo;ve pushed the WP boundaries far beyond what anyone thought of doing two years ago.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He thinks it is even more important that WordPress professionals to be able to build products that compete against the feature depth and &ldquo;sexiness&rdquo; of SaaS services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Think about how much more capital would stay within the WP ecosystem if you had a project management plugin that was as good as, say Clickup.com or Monday.com,&rdquo; said Bahadur. &ldquo;Or a CRM plugin that was as good as Hubspot. But to build plugins with that level of polish requires lots and lots of capital in the first place. Even though WP is a billion-dollar ecosystem, somehow we still don&rsquo;t have the ability to finance the build-out of world-class functional components with a world-class UX experience, and I think that&rsquo;s a shame &mdash; and a major opportunity for VCs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He does not think WPCloudDeploy has quite met the smoother UIs of SaaS services yet. However, he believes it can prove that it rivals or exceeds such competitors in terms of functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;So the next time someone asks, &lsquo;can you really build that on WP?&rsquo;, maybe they can point to WPCD and say, &lsquo;Hey, if you can build this on WP, then, hell yeah, we can build that thingamajig that you want&hellip;,&rdquo; said Bahadur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team maintains a Trello board with a <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/pYl53rvM/wpcloud-deploy-public-roadmap\">public roadmap</a>. The most-requested feature right now is support for OpenLiteSpeed, an open-source web server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Bahadur said the most tantalizing possibilities for the long term come from working with the REST API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Unlike SaaS tools, you&rsquo;ll be able to customize it using our built-in ones as a template,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ambitious agencies will be able to add their own plugin to extend our REST API without waiting for us to add new endpoints that meet their needs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, the core plugin will be available on GitHub. Developers will be able to contribute new endpoints to the core product via pull requests.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:26:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"WPTavern: Hacktoberfest Adds GitLab Support, Updates Participation Requirements to Combat Open Source Project Spam\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123630\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:271:\"https://wptavern.com/hacktoberfest-adds-gitlab-support-updates-participation-requirements-to-combat-open-source-project-spam?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hacktoberfest-adds-gitlab-support-updates-participation-requirements-to-combat-open-source-project-spam\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4410:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/hacktoberfest-is-back-2021/\">8th annual Hacktoberfest</a> is underway with a few important changes this year. <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\">Hacktoberfest</a>, a virtual event sponsored by DigitalOcean and community partners, has traditionally encouraged open source contribution during the month of October by rewarding participants with a t-shirt for submitting pull requests.

It was a commercial plugin his team at Pootlepress was gearing up to launch. Earlier this week, they released an updated version that he said he was happy with as an initial release. For a first outing, it has proved to be a handy plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept is not new. Plugins for dynamically injecting content in various places have long existed. In the past, these plugins have allowed users to create content through settings panels, widgets, or even the customizer. Some themes provide such options too. However, Block Injector is the first I have seen that takes this concept and moves it into the block arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin creates a new post type for creating injectable content. Essentially, users can add any blocks they want via the editor and display them at a custom location on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a coupon to show at the top of a specific post.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin has four different conditional rulesets that users can define:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Location:</strong> Which pages of the site the content appears on.</li><li><strong>Position:</strong> Where on the page the content should display.</li><li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Post IDs to exclude.</li><li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Date and time-based start and end dates.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Marsland published a six-minute video that breaks down how it all works:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/from-ecommerce-integration-to-location-based-controls-block-visibility-pro-expands-upon-its-free-version\">using Block Visibility</a>, a dedicated plugin for contextually displaying blocks, it is hard not to see anything else as inferior. Its location-based logic provides more flexibility than most will ever need. I have become accustomed to its granular controls. Block Injector&rsquo;s rules are limited in comparison but should work well for the majority of use cases.  I almost want to merge them to see what I can create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Injector really shines when paired with WooCommerce. The development team added several shop-specific location options.  They also expanded on the positioning rules to utilize a range of WooCommerce hooks. This can create a powerful set of tools for store owners, particularly for seasonal sales. For example, users can display a coupon for the month leading up to Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a coupon to show on the WooCommerce shop page.\n\n\n\n<p>One area where I hit a snag was with themes that had grid layouts on the homepage. When injecting content at the top or bottom, it would often get sucked into the post grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue is evident in the following screenshot when using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/flock\">Flock</a> theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>My expectation was that it would have spanned the area above the posts. However, I am not sure how easy this would be to fix from the plugin&rsquo;s end because there are only specific places where it is possible to hook into the front-end output. Attempting to correct this via CSS for all grid themes would be futile. However, as we continue to move toward 100% block themes in the future, it may open some alternative routes for injecting such content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, I like the direction I am seeing from this first version. Having run theme and general WordPress support for over a decade, I had an untold number of users ask for similar solutions. I doubt there was a week that went by where I did not field such a question. Block Injector should save many a lot of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would call the plugin <em>necessary</em> more so than particularly groundbreaking. The community needed someone to step up and build it for the block era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Marsland created a fake marketing video for the plugin if you are looking for a quick laugh:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Amazing to get this testimonial from Korean supergroup ELAST for our Block Injector plugin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wpfakes?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wpfakes</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7kFdq3CzYY\">pic.twitter.com/7kFdq3CzYY</a></p>&mdash; Pootlepress &ndash; busy building Gutenberg Blocks (@pootlepress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1444301141551026182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>That tweet is just one in a series of videos under the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wpfakes\">#WPFakes hashtag</a>, one of my favorite things on the internet right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.0.1, the copy I am currently testing, does have a few PHP errors when WooCommerce is not active in specific scenarios. These are trivial to fix, and I have passed along the details to the team. However, I did want to note this to readers who might consider purchasing this for use without WooCommerce. I expect the problems will be fixed in the next release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:39:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Default Theme Releases May Become More Frequent Following WordPress 5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123925\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:207:\"https://wptavern.com/default-theme-releases-may-become-more-frequent-following-wordpress-5-9?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=default-theme-releases-may-become-more-frequent-following-wordpress-5-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3240:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/birds-flying-MGGKWIS8CP\">Matt Bango</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress\">Twenty Twenty-Two default theme</a> coming in 5.9 hasn&rsquo;t even been fully built yet but many WordPress enthusiasts who saw yesterday&rsquo;s design reveal are already eager to use it on their sites. Contributors have just 40 days before the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/\">scheduled Beta 1 release</a> on November 16 to get the theme ready. While that seems like an impossibly tight deadline, more frequent default theme releases may be ahead on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a couple of short paragraphs tucked into the end of the announcement, Kjell Reigstad commented on the future of default theme release frequency:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The community has produced a dozen best-in-class themes together, and we&rsquo;ve come to look forward to a new one arriving at the close of each year. That said, themes are in a transition period today, and it seems like this may be a reasonable time to step back and to re-evaluate the annual cadence with which we build default themes.&nbsp;</p><p>Innovations like theme.json, block templates, and block patterns are making theme development far simpler, and are providing new ways for users to customize their sites. There&rsquo;s reason to believe that the community can leverage all this to build more frequent and diverse theme and customization solutions for our users in the coming years.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t clear whether Reigstad meant that the cadence of default theme releases would be slowing down or speeding up. I asked him for clarification and he confirmed that the idea is to consider the possibility of speeding up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I hope these new tools allow us to create and release more frequently than we&rsquo;ve been able to in the past,&rdquo; Reigstad said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The general idea came up as part of the ideation process for the default theme this year, and that part of the post is meant to give it a wider platform for conversation in the community. I&rsquo;m excited to hear what other folks think since this idea is in its very early days! I really think there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The ideation process he referenced, which varies from year to year, included early conversations with project leadership to plan and make sure the theme is aligned with the future of WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the discussion officially kicks off regarding increasing default theme release frequency, contributors are focused on getting Twenty Twenty-Two out the door. Reigstad said people can jump in on testing now, as the general structure is already in place. This includes fonts, colors, and basic templates, although details like spacing and specific block styles are still in progress along with block patterns.

There was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/heropress-launches-kickstarter-campaign-to-highlight-wordpress-developers\">some early pushback</a>, particularly from WordPress lead developer Andrew Nacin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin/status/558347928977145856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E558347928977145856%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fheropress-launches-kickstarter-campaign-to-highlight-wordpress-developers\">who cited</a> its &ldquo;unambiguous hero worship&rdquo; and the initial male-only lineup of speakers as problems. However, much has changed in the six years since the fundraiser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeRosia called the first fundraising event a test to see how the community would receive it. The project has never been funded financially since then. Hosting and resources have been provided for the project, and a few other companies have occasionally donated toward their time and tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite failing to raise their initial funds, the project continued onward. Today, HeroPress has been a success by simply providing a platform for people to share their journeys in the WordPress world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrey &ldquo;Rarst&rdquo; Savchenko wrote the <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-your-place/\">first essay</a> in March 2015. Since then, the site has published over 200 others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been a challenge to figure out how to fund the project,&rdquo; said DeRosia. &ldquo;When the pandemic hit and sponsors had money they couldn&rsquo;t use on WordCamps, they started some conversations with us. We&rsquo;ve been kicking around ideas since then and feel The HeroPress Network gives us the best resource for reasonable funding. We want to be giving value back to both the community and supporters, and the diversity of what makes up the Network provides more options.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If everything falls into place, DeRosia herself or one of their daughters could have a salaried position for the project. Her background is in English and journalism, and she described it as a &ldquo;dream job.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked DeRosia why she was personally vested in this project. What was it that got her up every morning to build it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Topher and I both grew up rural poor here in the US,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We come from communities dying because there aren&rsquo;t jobs. WordPress has always been such an excellent answer to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;With HeroPress.com we&rsquo;re able to provide a stage where people can tell their stories of how they&rsquo;ve built their lives regardless of where they lived or what circumstances they were living in. That&rsquo;s great, but it only goes so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now with The HeroPress Network, we can provide simplified, searchable access to practical tools that anyone can use to craft the life they want using the WordPress platform. We can also demonstrate how community and business can work together to get the best for both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If the option for something better is out there, I want to help people find it. Helping new people get started in WordPress brings a richness to the community that it needs to thrive. Helping established businesses connect with people and resources continues the growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so incredible to have the privilege to see people build relationships that allow them to flourish. And who wouldn&rsquo;t get out of bed every morning to do that?&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Oct 2021 23:44:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:143:\"WPTavern: First Look at WordPress’ Upcoming Twenty Twenty-Two Default Theme: “The Most Flexible Default Theme Ever Created for WordPress”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123061\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:311:\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4220:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/06/introducing-twenty-twenty-two/\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a>, the new default theme coming in WordPress 5.9, was unveiled today on WordPress.org. The design goes full steam ahead in support of full site editing and new customization capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like its predecessor, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/09/23/introducing-twenty-twenty-one/\">Twenty Twenty-One</a>, the new default theme makes some bold design choices wrapped around a central theme. In this case it&rsquo;s bird illustrations, complemented by <a href=\"https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-serif\">Source Serif Pro</a>&nbsp;for headlines, and a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2021/10/Example-Layouts-scaled.jpg\">delicious array of patterns</a> for limitless combinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Image Credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/06/introducing-twenty-twenty-two/\">Introducing Twenty Twenty-Two</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme will be <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/twentytwentytwo\">developed on GitHub</a> until it&rsquo;s ready to be merged into core. Kjell Reigstad, an Automattic sponsored full-time design contributor to WordPress.org, is leading the design with Jeff Ong leading development. In the announcement he sets expectations high for users to be able to make the theme their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the advent of Full Site Editing and Global Styles, themes are changing structurally and functionally to enable far more avenues for customization than users have come to expect in the past,&rdquo; Reigstad said. &ldquo;To take advantage of these new abilities, <strong>Twenty Twenty-Two has been designed to be the most flexible default theme ever created for WordPress.</strong>&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the wide variety of patterns expected to ship with this theme, Twenty Twenty-Two will offer a lively selection of six pre-designed color palettes. Reigstad shared a video preview of how they instantly change the character of the theme. (see below) Combine this with the promise of being able to manipulate every aspect of the theme&rsquo;s appearance through global styles, and users are in for a treat with WordPress 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Twenty Twenty-Two will take advantage of a wide&nbsp;network&nbsp;of page templates, headers, footers, and other patterns so that users can easily make the theme their own,&rdquo; Reigstad said. &ldquo;In another nod to the behavior of birds everywhere, these will offer a balance between fun and utility: some are irregular and unpredictable, while others are straightforward and traditional. Together, these patterns will act as a window into all of the possibilities that the theme enables.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design preview for Twenty Twenty-Two has received overwhelming positive <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmake.wordpress.org%2Fcore%2F2021%2F10%2F06%2Fintroducing-twenty-twenty-two%2F&src=typed_query\">feedback on Twitter</a> and in the comments of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/06/introducing-twenty-twenty-two/\">announcement</a>. Many users were excited to see a default theme that can be quickly transformed for so many applications. Too many default themes have only been applicable to a narrow set of use cases. In the past, users had little hope of being able to change things around to make the design work for their needs. Unrelenting progress on the block editor and full site editing has made it possible for Twenty Twenty-Two to become the most user-empowering default theme in WordPress&rsquo; history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigstad said the theme will be &ldquo;built for Full Site Editing first,&rdquo; with as little CSS as possible, and all theme styles configurable through theme.json wherever possible, so users can edit them through Global Styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Twenty Twenty-Two is designed with the acknowledgement that its default appearance is not most people&rsquo;s endpoint,&rdquo; Reigstad said. &ldquo;Everyone deserves a truly unique website, built on a solid, well-designed foundation, and Twenty Twenty-Two aims to help them achieve that.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Oct 2021 20:59:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"HeroPress: What’s Next For HeroPress?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=4162\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"https://heropress.com/whats-next-for-heropress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=whats-next-for-heropress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4748:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/nikola-jovanovic-OBok3F8buKY-unsplash-1024x685.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Closeup of a woman\'s hands holding a double handful of dirt with a green plant growing out of it.\" /><p>For years now people have been asking me &#8220;So what&#8217;s next for HeroPress?&#8221; and I didn&#8217;t have a good answer. I was content to let it just be inspirational essays forever. But as the years went by, I began to feel more and more that I wanted to go one step further, and start providing resources to those newly inspired people. Some direction, now that they&#8217;re convinced they that too can Do It.</p>\n<p>About a year ago my wife <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mysweetcate\">Cate</a> asked, &#8220;What if we were able to fund this, so I could take on the HeroPress work as my full time job? Then, we could start doing a lot more.&#8221; And thus began a series of conversations that still hasn&#8217;t ended.</p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t want to ask people to help financially without offering them something more in return, so we started brain storming about what we could make that people would value. We came up with MANY ideas which we didn&#8217;t follow up on, but we also came up with some GREAT ones that we <em>did</em> do.</p>\n<h3>Great Ideas We&#8217;ve Acted On</h3>\n<p>Last week we released <a href=\"https://wppodcasts.com\">WP Podcasts</a>, which aggregates all the episodes from all the WordPress podcasts we can find, so you can search by keyword or tag and find individual episodes across all of them.  For playback and subscription we direct you back to the original site, driving traffic back to the podcaster.</p>\n<p>You probably already know about <a href=\"https://hallwaychats.com\">Hallway Chats</a>, and then there&#8217;s <a href=\"https://heropress.com/\">this site</a> (HeroPress.com).</p>\n<p>Soon we’ll be releasing Find It WP (think Yahoo for WordPress), a curated listing of everything in WordPress. A curated listing of everything in WordPress.  Every podcast, every email newsletter, every dev agency, every theme shop, and on forever. If it&#8217;s WordPress, it&#8217;ll be in there, assuming they choose to sign up. There are a couple more sites in the hopper as well, but I&#8217;ll tell you more about them another day.</p>\n<h3>Today&#8217;s Announcement</h3>\n<p>TODAY I&#8217;m excited to announce the next new thing for HeroPress: <a href=\"https://heropressnetwork.com\">The HeroPress Network</a>. This is a site that serves several purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To aggregate everything from all of the HeroPress properties into one site, the latest essay, Hallway Chat, WordPress Podcast episode, new thing on Find It WP, etc.</li>\n<li>A community news blog. Think People magazine, but less smarmy.</li>\n<li>A platform for video and text tutorials and training produced by the HeroPress team. You can go <a href=\"https://heropressnetwork.com/video/saving-a-wordpress-search-as-rss/\">see the first WordPress Tip Of The Week right here</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Future Needs</h3>\n<p>As you can see, with what we have going on now plus what we have planned, we have MORE than enough work for a full time employee.</p>\n<p>For this reason, on October 24th 2021 we&#8217;re going to open up funding opportunities.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t an Event with a goal and a thermometer to track funds received, or balloons and a band. This is going to be more like a Patreon, where we&#8217;re looking for people who are willing to support the project long term. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, we won&#8217;t turn down one-time help, but if this is going to grow it needs long term support.</p>\n<p>On the technical side of funding, we&#8217;re choosing to use <a href=\"https://givewp.com\">GiveWP</a> instead of Patreon for a few important reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We&#8217;re all in on the WordPress ecosystem. We want to show that it can be done, and done well, in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Another is the old story of owning your platform. We don&#8217;t want to depend on other sites if we don&#8217;t have to. We&#8217;re going to have to write some code to make GiveWP work like Patreon, but that just means we&#8217;ll have one more thing to give back to the community.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s been nearly seven years since HeroPress started, and I&#8217;m excited to see it blossom into something even greater.</p>\n<p><span class=\"_1K5LX _1ByhS\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@danteov_seen?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Nikola Jovanovic</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/growing?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a> </span></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Oct 2021 20:07:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2021 Draws More Than 3600 Attendees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123714\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:159:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2021-draws-more-than-3600-attendees?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-us-2021-draws-more-than-3600-attendees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4687:\"<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US</a> took place online last Friday. Organizers pulled off a successful one-day event with an engaging group of speakers who highlighted timely and important topics. There were 3,608 people registered for the event and the livestream had as many as 400 concurrent viewers at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Online events are notoriously difficult to get attendee stats for, particularly an event like WCUS 2021 where the audience is global and spans so many time zones,&rdquo; WCUS organizer Cate DeRosia said. &ldquo;Many people will watch what they can and catch the rest in their own time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We really love this as it makes for not only a more accessible event, but a more educational experience as it&rsquo;s so easy to rewatch a session as many times as an individual needs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jati/status/1443978800010711045\">asked on Twitter</a> why the event&rsquo;s organizers didn&rsquo;t opt to use a more interactive event platform like Hopin or Veertly, organizer Jen Swisher said some of the platforms they looked into had accessibility issues or prohibitive costs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the leadership trio for WCUS, Swisher said the team had three issues they focused on when choosing a virtual venue: cost, accessibility, and time for implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We had a $30K budget,&rdquo; Swisher said. &ldquo;To use one of these platforms would have doubled it minimum. There was also a strong chance we would have faced additional costs from our production company for our resources through them to learn this new platform and connect it with their equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This would have resulted in additional time and resources spent on fundraising or increasing the costs of our sponsor packages. This would have forced the volunteers on the sponsors team to do twice as much work to get the sponsorship necessary to fund other platforms.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the simple setup of two YouTube livestreams, organizers provided a high energy, welcoming reception to attendees. They managed to bring some levity during these challenging times apart from one another. Swisher highlighted a few deliberate choices organizers made to give this year&rsquo;s event a more lightweight feeling:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t try to replicate the in person experience,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Making the choice to actively recognize that this isn&rsquo;t like in person events in any way gave everyone permission to think about this event differently. By throwing out &lsquo;the book,&rsquo; and starting from scratch, we were able to really &lsquo;dream&rsquo; for the event, instead of what it could have been.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of planning a big multi-day event, organizers opted for a single day focusing on a smaller subset of topics. They also selected chat moderators and emcees that would bring enthusiasm to the event and gave them the autonomy to make decisions on the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The team agreed that a big event with multiple days and large numbers of tracks would be exhausting to plan and exhausting for attendees to sit through,&rdquo; Swisher said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2020-canceled-due-to-pandemic-stress-and-online-event-fatigue\">WordCamp US 2020 was cancelled</a> due to pandemic stress and online event fatigue, the organizing team needed to make some changes to avoid the pitfalls of the previous year. Organizers were drained, spread thin, and frustrated by delayed tasks and external stressors. The WCUS 2021 team turned this around to make it a more healthy culture for volunteers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We fostered an atmosphere where stepping back to take care of yourself was strongly encouraged,&rdquo; Swisher said. &ldquo;This resulted in a team of folks that was well rested and able to handle the extra responsibility that comes with planning a WordCamp.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We gave the teams the autonomy necessary to get their work done. Decision making was done democratically, but decisions that didn&rsquo;t impact the whole team didn&rsquo;t involve the whole team, making it possible to move more agilely.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speaker selection was outstanding this year and the recorded sessions will soon be available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a> after the production team finishes uploading them.

Hello Lee.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:04:16]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Hey Nathan.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:04:17]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s lovely to have you on the podcast today. Before we get stuck into it, I&rsquo;ll ask the traditional set of mandatory questions at the start. Would you mind telling us a little bit about yourself, your background in WordPress, technology? You can go back as far as you feel necessary. Probably limit it to the WordPress side of things.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:04:35]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. So I was born in Columbus, Ohio, but I shouldn&rsquo;t go back to Ohio days. Huh? I shouldn&rsquo;t go back all the way back to my birth. So I am a self-taught developer, mostly front end developer, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for about 10 years. I started building custom client sites and I made my way to WordPress about five years ago. And really, the thing that actually really drew me in was when Gutenberg launched, because it really used all my skillsets of JavaScript, React, CSS. And so since then, I&rsquo;ve been really the last five years or so been focused on building blocks. I kind of nonstop, but kind of had an insane obsession with it. You could ask my wife, all I do is talk about blocks and building blocks. So to pay the bills, I&rsquo;ve been building client sites and I&rsquo;ve been trying to build tools with blocks to help streamline my processes of the client work. So that&rsquo;s what brings me here today. Is that black building obsession.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:05:39]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Very nice. Well, we will get thoroughly immersed in all of that in a little while. Just before that, I wanted to know what your thoughts are on whether or not WordPress needed to put this into core, the ability to build your website now let&rsquo;s say, but initially, to create your content around blocks. Did you feel at the time, obviously subsequently you&rsquo;ve gotten into it and been enjoying what it has brought to the table, but I&rsquo;m wondering if you can cast your mind back to that time when it did come in. Was there a light that went off and you thought, actually this is tremendously interesting or were you like many people were, and to some extent still are kind of reluctant to use it and keen to have the old editor back or move away to some sort of proprietary page builder?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:06:25]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Being a front end developer, when I started hearing about React being in WordPress, that really got me going, because to me, it really opens up a bunch of possibilities that can really allow you to build, you know, really snappy interfaces and really fun products and stuff that you couldn&rsquo;t build before.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You can almost, I know there&rsquo;s been talk about WordPress being the OS of the internet. And I think it really opens up that possibility. I started dipping my toes into WordPress right before Gutenberg launched. And I did a deep dive into building themes and plugins the old way. And then right about a year into me learning how to do that, I started diving deep into Gutenberg. And, I definitely think it was a good move. Although all change, you know, change can sometimes be painful and there&rsquo;s definitely a steep learning curve, but I think the pain is going to be worth it in the long run.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:07:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I feel that at the moment, there is a lot of pain being experienced by a variety of different people. And some people like yourself have decided to absorb that pain and go with it. Other people have found it very difficult and there&rsquo;s been politics, shall we say has crept into WordPress in a way that I&rsquo;ve not really seen too much of before, and people wishing that it hadn&rsquo;t have been put into core and that it had of been a plugin instead. Other people obviously just wished that the entire thing would go away and ended up forking WordPress and creating this ClassicPress version of WordPress. So it has really divided the community. I feel that maybe talks like this, will address that a little bit because you&rsquo;ve obviously been exploring it and you&rsquo;ve probably got some great ideas about things that it will enable that perhaps the rest of us haven&rsquo;t really foreseen.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I know for my part, I&rsquo;ve seen a few videos of things that people are building. Products that are either just about to come out or have already come out and you just think, okay, that&rsquo;s interesting because that&rsquo;s totally wedded to the idea of a block and without the block methodology, that exact thing could not have been done, possibly even as a plugin. So I&rsquo;m just curious if you&rsquo;ve got any thoughts about what can be done with blocks that we could not have done before.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:08:44]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m going to go as a bold as to say, I think, think of every traditional plugin or theme business in WordPress. I believe with the advent of Gutenberg, everything is ripe for disruption.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think every single aspect, like think about forms or think about pop-ups or think about payments. Really any facet of the WordPress economy that you can think of, that people are making a living on, I think it could be disrupted with Gutenberg.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:09:15]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. I think you&rsquo;re probably right. We&rsquo;ve certainly seen some . Of those things. I&rsquo;ve seen some projects certainly around the forms space where, you know, you just think, oh, well the interface of Gutenberg really does lend itself to creating sort of drag and drop form builder. It&rsquo;s really remarkable for that. Aside from those sort of more general ideas, do you have any concrete examples of things that you&rsquo;ve gotten yourself into and projects that you&rsquo;ve created, or been party to where there&rsquo;s been an end result that we could all identify with and understand why you&rsquo;re so excited about it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:09:46]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;ve been building blocks, all kinds of different types of blocks, trying to uncover. I run a small agency, so my workflow and system of building a site for client is super important to me. And I know there are a ton of tools with the classic way of building WordPress built around optimizing that workflow. But that&rsquo;s really been my focus is how do we leverage the system to really like streamline the workflow of building sites for clients? I build a lot of sites for fun for myself. Really. I&rsquo;m all about building quickly.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I don&rsquo;t know if I told you this Nathan, but when I was in my previous life, I used to own a restaurant and I came up with, you know, the menu and the food, and imagine it was an Italian version of Chipotle at the early days of Chipotle, and, you know, I ran it for a couple years and it just failed miserably. I lost, I kind of lost everything in that. But I learned a lot of great lessons and one of those lessons was I want to be able to keep stepping up to the plate. And in order to do that, to keep trying, I needed to come up with systems and processes that allow me to do that in a way that it isn&rsquo;t heavy handed. And I can just hack away at an idea in a day. And I kinda think that is the essence of WordPress. And I think that Gutenberg is kind of taken us back to that essence of, okay, what can I hack away at? I think we&rsquo;re just starting to hit the point of stability with Gutenberg and with full site editing coming out and block-based themes where you&rsquo;re going to be able to build full blown prototypes and mock-ups of, you know, not just like static sites, but some pretty complex stuff pretty quickly. Imagine launching, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw Flip WP, they&rsquo;re launching a marketplace for selling WordPress plugins and themes and WordPress businesses. I think something like that is going to become a lot easier to do. Like iterating on an idea like Flip WP, like say I want to try it, test the waters of building a marketplace for buying and selling WordPress businesses. I think, being able to build startups and more complex businesses is going to become a lot easier to do with Gutenberg</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:12:10]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>When you&rsquo;ve been creating your blocks at the beginning, I&rsquo;m just curious as to how obviously you fell into it and you&rsquo;re now enjoying it. Were there any significant obstacles along the way that you encountered? So as an example, was there enough documentation? Was it fairly easy to get yourself up to speed with how to create your own blocks? Was there a lot of support around? Were there some channels or books that you perhaps ended up relying upon? I&rsquo;m just trying to get to the idea of how easy or difficult it was, or perhaps still is.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:12:39]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you. It&rsquo;s been a challenge. It&rsquo;s been a frustrating journey. There&rsquo;s been documentation and there&rsquo;s been the Gutenberg GitHub repo has been a great resource for, learning as well. Just seeing how they&rsquo;re doing things, but it hasn&rsquo;t been easy. I actually, you know, a tool. I think you actually heard me talking about it at wpplugin dot com where you can quickly generate a block plugin. And the idea behind that is there&rsquo;s all these different mental models of building a block. I think the hardest part is learning, what can you do with a block? How can you do it? And shaping that mental model has really been a challenge. Honestly, I&rsquo;ve been very self driven and if it wasn&rsquo;t for that, that really has kept me going. I&rsquo;ve had a long-term view of where everything&rsquo;s going and from the place I&rsquo;m coming from being a front end developer, it&rsquo;s really made it, it has made it easier for me. I do think, if somebody really wants to learn blocks, they need to learn React. And I think something like taking like Wes Bos&rsquo;s React for beginners course, I took that course and it&rsquo;s a great resource for learning React. Just getting kind of the nuts and bolts of, you know, the underpinnings of Gutenberg.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:14:00]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Would you say that, obviously it was fairly difficult as you&rsquo;ve described, but were you able to begin to see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel fairly quickly? Or was it one of these learning journeys where it&rsquo;s more of a cliff climb until finally you reach the pinnacle? You&rsquo;ve acquired enough knowledge that suddenly it becomes, oh, I can do it all now. This is fabulous. Or were you able to get something out from your limited learning?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:14:24]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I feel like I&rsquo;m there now. I&rsquo;m at that place. I mean, I&rsquo;m still learning, but I feel like I&rsquo;m at a point now where I can kind of shape the editor to what my vision is. But it has been a lot of hard work, but I&rsquo;ve, I feel like I&rsquo;ve kind of seen the vision for where WordPress wants to go for a long time. It really resonated with me and I can really get behind where they ultimately want to go. I think that all of this, it&rsquo;s going to be worthwhile taking the time to really dig in and learn. And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen it, there&rsquo;s been some talk about creating. I know there&rsquo;s like Advanced Custom Fields has a block builder. There&rsquo;s been some talk about creating some PHP based tools for building blocks. I&rsquo;m not sure it might be a third-party. It&rsquo;s just a, some conversation I saw on Twitter there quite an extensive conversation about people testing out ways to build blocks from a more PHP standpoint, where the PHP would kind of generate the React for you. And so like this layer between, okay, we have Advanced Custom Fields for doing 80% of what you want to do. And then this other PHP solution potentially being like a similar tool that gets you most of the way there. If you really want to dive deep and do some more complex stuff, take you the rest of the 20% of the way, then you&rsquo;d really need to learn React and how it works in the editor.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:15:46]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I feel maybe this is the point at which people who are struggling with the way things are going in WordPress at the moment. Maybe this is the point of contention, it was introduced and suddenly all of the skills and the techniques and, the years and years of expertise that they built up, it kind of felt like it was crumbling before their eyes. And they may be in a position where they&rsquo;re managing to carry on their business, whatever it is, something to do with WordPress, their agency, or what have you. And simply don&rsquo;t have the time to upskill and to learn new things. And maybe that&rsquo;s the problem is that there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who simply don&rsquo;t have the time. They don&rsquo;t have the energy anymore. They don&rsquo;t have the desire. And they want to just sort of keep going with the same tools that they&rsquo;ve been using for a such a long time. Obviously it sounds like you, fairly driven, able to allocate enough time to do all of that and obviously fit it in around your business. But maybe there&rsquo;s, maybe there&rsquo;s some people for whom that is just too much of a stretch?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:16:41]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You know, I can understand if all of a sudden Gutenberg was pulled out from under me, I think I&rsquo;d throw my hands up right now. Uh, I&rsquo;ve had a business, I was working on, pulled out from under me and I, it hurts. And it&rsquo;s like, ah, dude, you know, do I want to do I want to keep going? But, but here&rsquo;s the thing is I think Gutenberg is getting to the point where, we&rsquo;re hitting a stability that could be used in production for like client sites. I think we&rsquo;re hitting that point right now. Once Full Site Editing, I think after the next release. I&rsquo;ve started building, I&rsquo;ve kind of been doing both the old way of doing things for some clients and the new way of doing things. I&rsquo;ve been doing it simultaneously to see, okay, how stable are we for using this stuff in production versus using something like Elementor page builder or Beaver Builder or something like that?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think we&rsquo;re coming up on that point where people can start making the switch and dipping their toes in. And I don&rsquo;t think you have to focus a hundred percent of your time or focus a big chunk of your time to start diving into that. The new block-based themes, it uses this thing called a theme bot json file and that really sets up. You just fill out this file, like basically a data structure with what you want and you have a full flesh theme in the block editor. I think that the tools and the tooling and WordPress and Gutenberg itself are all getting to this point where we can start using it, and it&rsquo;s not going to be a ton of time. And then once you start using these tools, You&rsquo;re going to want to start doing more and more with them, and you can start easing your way into building blocks with ACF or from scratch or whatever.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:18:33]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It seems to me that it might be the case that many people who have not really dabbled too much in the block editor have gone in there at some point, installed vanilla version of WordPress, made sure that it was all up and running and what have you, and then when in, started typing and found that experience fairly decent, certainly from my part, it&rsquo;s much better for simply typing things than the classic editor ever was. Just for the ability to move paragraphs and things around. And then of course you notice this sort of curious sidebar, which is full of these blocks that you can put on to the page, and so, a paragraph is a block. A button is a block. A heading is a block. And so it kind of feels a bit like this text interface where the blocks are a bit like, okay, obviously I&rsquo;m using paragraphs now. That&rsquo;s fine. I can understand that. But then you sort of notice that there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff attached to the block and the block brings along with it, all these different settings. And so you can modify that one paragraph in its entirety, all in one, go by clicking some buttons, you know, that might be the color or what have you. And all of a sudden, your mind starts getting taken over with, oh, so the block has got settings with it. Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting. Okay. So what I&rsquo;m trying to say there is if you&rsquo;ve not been back into the block editor for a long time, and you&rsquo;ve just really seen it as a conduit to creating content, it is much more than that. And it&rsquo;s hard to express how much more it is unless you&rsquo;ve actually configured or played with a block that does a lot more than you could ever have done inside the classic editor. So I&rsquo;m wondering if you&rsquo;ve got any nice concrete examples of things that you&rsquo;ve achieved, the things that you&rsquo;ve been able to do inside of a block where people might go, oh, that&rsquo;s curious. I didn&rsquo;t realize that blocks could even do that kind of thing.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:20:25]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Actually, my brother is an accountant and, he does a lot of work with startups and when COVID first hit and they started doing the PVP loans and everything, I actually built a calculator for him, for his business to share with his clients. And I built it all in blocks and the calculator would, it would generate, you know, you would just put in whatever your income is and how many employees and it would generate. You can actually see it in the wild. If you go to stimulus benefits dot com, I have a calculator in there. That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a block. All this is all built in WordPress. You&rsquo;ll probably notice this theme. I think this was the 2020 theme. And honestly, it&rsquo;s pretty cool. It&rsquo;s pretty snappy. And this is just like something that I built for fun for my brother, you know? So if you want it to build, imagine, you&rsquo;re in the real estate business and you wanted to build out a full fledged mortgage calculator. I know there&rsquo;s a ton of realtors, real estate agents, real estate businesses that use mortgage calculators in their business to direct their clients to. I mean, you could absolutely do that. Very quickly and easily.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:21:36]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The principle there is that your brother then has a block inside of his WordPress installed, which he can then just with the click of a button throw on to any post or page, uh, it&rsquo;s not a weird shortcode thing where he&rsquo;s got a plugin installed over there and he&rsquo;s got to go and find the right shortcode and then copy and paste it into the right part. It&rsquo;s just all of that functionality. The logic behind the calculator is all contained inside of a block. And so for him as the end user, presumably it&rsquo;s just really easy to deploy that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:22:06]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s a custom plugin. He could add it to any, you know, any site anywhere and what you see on the front end, of the site is what you also see in the editor. And then in the editor, you can change things like the background color, the border radius, the font color, the text. I mean, all the texts editable, which was really important because, everything was always changing. The rules of the game were changing. So he needed to be able to go in and edit the content of the calculator. So to me, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s super exciting that here&rsquo;s this thing that, like you&rsquo;re saying it would have been a short code. You throw the short code in and then say you go to the customizer. If you want to change the background color, you know, the fonts and add some custom CSS. This no, you you stay in the block editor and you just click a button. Okay. If you look at the calculator now it&rsquo;s got a black background. It&rsquo;d be really easy to change it to a white background with black text and then change out the font. And really you can kind of go as far as you want to go with this, I could see endless just calculators alone. I could see endless business opportunity.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:23:13]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>In a way, the idea of blocks, just being a conduit for putting content on the website. Yes. But it&rsquo;s also in a sense it&rsquo;s like a mini it&rsquo;s like a mini little application it&rsquo;s as you said, you created a plugin and what have you, but the complexity really has no limits. It&rsquo;s only the limits of what you&rsquo;re capable of coming up with and whatever it is that you&rsquo;ve built with all of its amazing, difficult capabilities could just be dropped in ad infinitum all over the place. And the sky, as you say, is the limit. And I feel like we&rsquo;re just turning a bit of a corner and some of the ideas are starting to come into the marketplace. Now, some really curious ideas about a whole different functionalities that are being wrapped up into blocks that we simply couldn&rsquo;t have done before.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:23:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m super excited because the fact that I could just create a calculator and drop it into a hundred sites, and then imagine I build a block base theme, say I build a block-based seam for like realtors, for example, I add this mortgage calculator, it&rsquo;s baked into it. I just can see all kinds of different, you know, additional tools like you&rsquo;re saying that you can get as complex as you want, but I also think blocks also offer this, a perfect canvas for constraint as well. You can go as complex as you want, but you also do want to make it easy for people to make changes to these little mini applications that we&rsquo;re building.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:24:35]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think one of the concerns that I have, amongst many other people, I&rsquo;m sure is. It&rsquo;s just this notion of people getting a bit click happy when installing blocks. The idea that there&rsquo;s a plugin for that in WordPress could easily be flipped to, well, there&rsquo;s a block for that. Non-technical users going out and looking through the block repository and installing things, and then kind of having to scratch their head and say, Hmm. My site really does seem to be very slow and then ultimately blaming WordPress for that, because that&rsquo;s the software it&rsquo;s built upon. I think you&rsquo;re right. Is it a good point to raise the one of constraint? Just because something exists, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you should install 50 of them and use them all at the same time.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:25:13]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I do think that a certain level of constraint does breed creativity. So I think that, you know, the more we can focus on making it really easy for people. Make it as easy as possible to do something, the better. So I think like patterns, the block patterns for example, are going to be a huge boon to making it easy. Try multiple homepages or contact pages about pages or pricing tables or any part of a site that you can think of. It&rsquo;s going to be really easy to add that to your site.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:25:44]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Have you been playing with block patterns a lot? And if so, are you pleased with where the system is right now for making all of that and surfacing them in the UI for you?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:25:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I am super excited about where block patterns are going. I think they open up a ton of possibilities. If I were going to be dipping my toes right now, say I haven&rsquo;t started building blocks. That&rsquo;s where I would start honestly, is start building out some patterns because it&rsquo;s really cool to go into the editor and create this pattern and then be able to just move it from site to site seamlessly, and have it just work.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:26:23]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you feel there&rsquo;s a new marketplace, a new job, if you like, emerging? We&rsquo;ve traditionally in WordPress, we&rsquo;ve had lots of people employed building websites, that&rsquo;s one niche, if you like, and then had other people working within agencies, possibly building bigger websites and on the code side, if you like, we&rsquo;ve had people creating plugins and themes and making commercial products out of those. Do you see blocks in that way that there&rsquo;s going to be a nice commercial interest in people going out and finding affordable blocks that do the one or two simple things that they need?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:26:59]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I do think there will be. I just, I don&rsquo;t know if those are out there quite yet to find. What I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of though, is these ecosystems popping up around a set of custom blocks, and then patterns to use with those blocks and core blocks and then multiple themes. And so I see the business evolving into more of these like mini ecosystems and that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve been building is focused on here&rsquo;s a set of custom blocks, custom patterns and themes for different types of use cases to get you quickly up and running.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:27:39]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>One of the things that I&rsquo;ve noticed is I&rsquo;ve seen that there are quite a few people at the moment trying to make a living out of this, and it seems, the most common way to do it at the moment is to come out with these block packs. And we&rsquo;re just going to use that phrase. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s what these companies go by, but they release a suite of 5, 10, 15, 20 or so on, blocks that hopefully will cover almost every aspect.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you get yourself involved in any of those? Do you use any of the things which are available on the market at the moment, or are you all about just if I need it, I&rsquo;m going to make it myself?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:28:09]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I definitely do. I love to see, and use what&rsquo;s out there. I&rsquo;ve used a bunch of different block collections on different projects, such as CoBlocks. And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen Stackable, WP Stackable? I know we were just talking about the GenerateBlocks and I see a lot of chatter on Twitter about people using GenerateBlocks. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen another one, that I just think is it&rsquo;s just beautiful called Aino Blocks, A, I, N, O, WP Aino dot com. Ellen Bauer has put together. I used to buy her WordPress themes and her and her co-founder put together a set of blocks, a limited set of custom blocks and then patterns. And they&rsquo;re going to be creating themes as well. Right now it&rsquo;s free to start using I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s going to be, you know, some way of them monetizing that product.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:29:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that there&rsquo;s going to be more people dipping their toes into the commercial waters as time goes on, because it does feel as if this is the future for WordPress. And one thing that I&rsquo;m quite interested to see is, there&rsquo;ll be like an, almost like little micro blocks that just do one thing, but do it really well and go into some sort of different pricing structure. So as an example, on the PC or the Mac, if you buy an app, it&rsquo;s usually there&rsquo;s a reasonable amount of dollars expended on purchasing that app. I mean, if you go onto the iOS or the Android side, something much more slim is available and it costs significantly less, just a few dollars. And I&rsquo;m curious to see if this business model emerges, where we get an innovative block, which just does one small thing, but does it really well, I can&rsquo;t actually conjure anything up at the moment out of my head that may fulfill that bill, but I&rsquo;m really interested to see if those kinds of things start to emerge.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:30:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I definitely think there will. I personally, I would love to focus just on building those, but I feel like I almost feel like it&rsquo;s got a, it feels like things need to go broad first and then narrow down to the specific use cases. But I have seen one really cool niche plugin is block visibility by Nick Diego. If you, if you&rsquo;re not following Nick on Twitter, you should. His plugin makes it really easy to show and hide blocks depending on different use cases, even. For example, he has an integration with WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads. And you can set visibility based on a schedule and if a customer purchased a product or not. So say you bought a product and two weeks ago, and then you can have a block pop up two weeks later and say, Hey, how&rsquo;s it going? Would love your feedback if you&rsquo;re enjoying using our plugin, leave us a review. So I do think that we&rsquo;re starting to see those and that is, you know, one of the best examples that I&rsquo;ve seen out there.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:31:11]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s like a little application just inside of a block. There&rsquo;s a lot of heavy lifting going on there. Isn&rsquo;t that, you know, if it&rsquo;s checking, the conditions to be right to, to make itself visible. You can imagine all sorts of permutations for the usefulness of that. Certainly in terms of marketing or perhaps hiding content that you want to be invisible to people who aren&rsquo;t members of your subscriber base or whatever it might be.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the point for me is that blocks bring all of this, as yet un thought-out, potential. Whereas previously, there was just essentially text on a page with a bit of formatting and some shortcodes thrown in if you wanted to add extra functionality. And now the functionality is all within the block. And so are the settings and it&rsquo;s all in one simple, hopefully, user interface. Speaking of the user interface, just staying on the block editor. So we&rsquo;re recording this kind of near to the middle of 2021. And I&rsquo;m just conscious that there&rsquo;s a lot of comparisons made all the time between what the commercial page builders can do and what the block editor can do, and I&rsquo;m always curious to know what people&rsquo;s opinions are about how easy it is to put things together, put complicated block layouts together and create things which are beautiful because, I certainly still experience moments where I&rsquo;m really not sure if what I&rsquo;m looking at in the block editor is going to look how I expect it to when I finally publish it and check it out on the front end. So just wondered if you had any thoughts about its utility as a sort of what you see is what you get, or if there&rsquo;s still a ways to go?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:32:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think that ultimately that is going to come down to the themes and then any supporting block plugins that ship with those themes. With any page builder, any like major commercial page builder, there&rsquo;s a learning curve and yeah, what you see, what is, what you get out of the box with Elementor, but if you want to change something, if you&rsquo;re just getting started, it can feel daunting to dive into all those settings. I do think the responsibility falls more to the theme builders in and the plugin builders to make sure that that experience happens. Myself, I&rsquo;m working on what I&rsquo;m calling a minimalis page builder that I&rsquo;m hoping to shorten that learning curve. And to also, I want to take responsibility for making sure that what you see in the editor is what you see on the front end.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, you know, I do. It&rsquo;s up to me and everyone else that is building out these experiences to make that happen. Off the shelf, if you used, you know, a core WordPress theme, you get your experience in the editor and on the front end is pretty seamless. There may be minor differences, but I mean, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re pretty much seeing what you&rsquo;re getting on the frontend.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:33:59]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Just curious because you dropped a few names earlier and I thought that was quite interesting because some of the people that you&rsquo;d mentioned I&rsquo;d heard of, and some of them, I hadn&rsquo;t. So I&rsquo;m wondering if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind just rattling off a couple of projects that you have seen and you thought that was good. And if you can attach some names to those as well, we&rsquo;ll try and make sure they go in the show notes along with this, on the WP Tavern website. So yeah, just a list of block projects that you think are worth keeping an eye on either because they&rsquo;re already fully fledged or they just seem like they&rsquo;re onto the cusp of doing something great. And some names to go with that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:34:31]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Nick Diego, his block visibility, plugin block visibility wp dot com. And then I follow Nick on Twitter too. He&rsquo;s always sharing updates. And if you&rsquo;re into building blocks, valuable content there, Ellen Bauer with WP Aino A I N O dot com has some beautiful block patterns and custom blocks that you can start using right away. GenerateBlocks, of course, we mentioned Mike Oliver. He just released a new set of block patterns that, a beautiful set of block patterns that you can start using. And then I know you and I mentioned Brian Gardner&rsquo;s launching Frost WP. He&rsquo;s going to be launching a set, I think it&rsquo;s already launched actually at frostwp dot com.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So I can&rsquo;t go without saying too that Rich Tabor, he is the creator of CoBlocks and he, I think he sold that to GoDaddy. He&rsquo;s always working on something interesting and sharing cutting edge stuff with regards to building blocks block-based themes and plugins. So he&rsquo;d be worth taking a look at.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:35:38]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s very nice. I will be sure to mention those. One which I&rsquo;ll drop in, which I think is quite an interesting block-based, well, it is literally like a little application within WordPress. There&rsquo;s something called Newsletter Glue. Don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve come across this, but&hellip;</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:35:52]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Lesley, how could I forget Lesley?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:35:56]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Lesley Sim and her colleague, her co-founder have created a mechanism whereby you can repurpose your blog posts and they will instantly become newsletters, which sounds like the sort of thing you&rsquo;ve been able to do by scraping an RSS feed or something like that. But there&rsquo;s a lot more to it. For example, you can drag in a block, which will only be visible inside the post or alternatively, you could make it only visible inside the newsletter. And it does a lot more than that, but just that one simple little thing that you can do means that you can create a newsletter and have it look completely different in the newsletter than it does on your, the front end of your website. It&rsquo;s really interesting for me, it demonstrates perfectly why the block editor is going to be so useful in the future, because this was unimaginable without the context of blocks. It couldn&rsquo;t have been made in what we used to use in WordPress.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:36:49]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>To think about making a newsletter you generally have to, I would think go off site. And I use Newsletter Glue in a lot of my clients sites and it really makes it effortless to put together a newsletter and send it out. When you hit that send button. So like, did that really just send that this from WordPress, this is crazy!</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:37:07]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>But just the level of complexity going on there, the fact that it&rsquo;s doing a lot of heavy lifting, it&rsquo;s reaching out to third-party services and doing things, but only at the moment that you click publish and it&rsquo;s sending over HTML and telling the websites over there, right, go on, publish it right away to this list or that list. It&rsquo;s really remarkable. And it&rsquo;s, for me makes me feel that in the future, there&rsquo;ll be a lot more interoperability with SaaS platforms and other things like that built inside of blocks. So that I don&rsquo;t know, maybe your content management system, WordPress can reach out and have interactions with blocks with your CRM in some way, who knows?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>This is what I&rsquo;m finding exciting is that we&rsquo;re at the point where the technology is now available, but we don&rsquo;t yet have the history of developers trying out all their ideas. We did that with plugins. There must&rsquo;ve been a similar moment with plugins where it was a lovely idea. Look, we can extend WordPress, but there wasn&rsquo;t really so much out there yet. So plugins felt a bit like, well, it&rsquo;s a thing, but you know, I&rsquo;m not that bothered, but then look what happened. There really was a boom in plugins and they became&hellip; you know, you couldn&rsquo;t really have a functioning WordPress website without a few plugins here and there. And I feel the same will be true in the near future with blocks.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-leeshadle vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Lee Shadle</cite> [00:38:19]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I really hope we can make building blocks easier because I think we&rsquo;re just starting to see, like you&rsquo;re saying some of these really neat things come out and you really could build anything you wanted in WordPress, if you know what you&rsquo;re doing.

The entire event was planned in eight weeks — which was not widely known until mentioned by lead organizer Jen Swifter during closing remarks. This marks the first WordCamp US without Matt Mullenweg’s “State of the Word,” although due to the event being virtual it’s presumed Matt will be holding the SotW as a separate virtual “event” closer to the end of the year — similar to last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two track event still brought fresh content and had what could be argued as one of the most diverse speaker lineups for a single day at WordCamp US — at least when it comes to “new to WCUS” speakers. New faces — even on screens rather than a stage — are welcome to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event sold over 3000 tickets, which for a WordCamp US and a virtual event with limited marketing time is quite good. Of course not everyone might have showed up but I could easily get the feeling that this was a large event from the activity in the online chat and from Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\"><strong>Update:</strong> WordCamp US released an official response when asked about registered and attending members.<br /><br />&#8220;<em>We had 3608 people register for the event and had as many as 400 concurrent viewers at one time.<br /><br />Online events are notoriously difficult to get attendee stats for, particularly an event like WCUS 2021 where the audience is global and spans so many time zones. Many people will watch what they can and catch the rest in their own time.<br /><br />We really love this as it makes for not only a more accessible event, but a more educational experience as it’s so easy to rewatch a session as many times as an individual needs.</em>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is difficult to give highlights of the talks since I was part of the programming team that helped add these talks to the program. I decided not to watch pre-recorded presentations prior to the day of WordCamp US to make the experience as similar to a regular attendee’s experience as possible. For that reason, I couldn’t cover all the talks live, and there are still a few talks I need to go back and watch. But I can cover some highlights and point out some notable presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\"><strong>Note:</strong> Until WCUS talks are published on WordPress.tv, you can use <a href=\"https://mburnette.com/blog/wordcamp-us-2021/\">this guide</a> to view them timestamped in the live stream on YouTube thanks to Marcus Burnette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon’s talk on accessibility was well received by the audience at the start of the event. Bet noted that “25% of all adults in the US have a permanent or temporary disability,” so the subject material should apply to many site builders. Jill Binder came afterwards to give an inspirational story about her journey to being a diversity team leader for a team that in 2020 exists in 71 cities across 17 countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Cory Webb and Rich Tabor delivered what could be caled the “introduction” and “showcase” talks related to the block editor. Most talks in this particular track had some connection to the block editor or the latest major enhancements in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were lightning talks after a <em>very</em> entertaining “musical break” — or what would be considered lunch for an in-person event. I wasn’t able to fully digest them all, but many of these performers featured rarely seen or new faces in the WordPress community:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/sienna-svob/\">Sienna Svob</a> covered sustainability, recommending that WordPress designers use fewer resources when possible and lean on hosts that use renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/lesley-sim/\">Lesley Sim</a> of Newsletter Glue offered a no-slide presentation on how to make friends with early customers, and she reminded product builders to “create the expectation you’re helpful and easy to reach.” Lesley also reminded us that “anything you do for the first time [in business and marketing] is going to be awkward.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are running an ecommerce site, <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/lax-mariappan/\">Lax Mariappan</a>’s talk is a good one to watch. In a similar vein, if you are running a community or are a WordCamp / Meetup organizer I would recommend <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/shusei-toda/\">Shusei Toda</a>‘s talk on lessons learned from WordCamp Tokyo 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another presentation for designers and theme developers would be Tammie Lister’s “Let Themes Be Themes” talk which will likely find a special place in the heart of those yearning for inspiration as we head into the next-generation of WordPress themes with full site editing and the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For entertainment, <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/taco-verdonschot/\">Taco Verdonschot</a> scored some points for using his own green screen in his talk on recharging your social batteries. This was a timely talk when many of us still work almost completely remotely via Zoom and Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second half of WordCamp US seemed to go by quickly. Two key talks about WordPress.org contributions were featured in one track. The first by members of the WordPress Training team focused on the Learn.WordPress.org resource. Support for Leearn will make a big impact in the coming days — we’ll do a deeper dive into this subject in the future — and I do agree that one day visiting a WordPress.org profile might be key part of the hiring process by companies looking for WordPress professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other key talk was given by <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/amyjune-hineline/\">AmyJune Hineline</a> who covered how many ways you can contribute and reviewed all the available groups at make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers got a treat when <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/helen-hou-sandi/\">Helen Hou-Sandi</a> showed how the new White House site was built in six weeks with WordPress and over a dozen custom blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“[10up] did 12 weeks work of hours in 6. Q&A; as we went. People were trusted to Q&A; their own work, no additional layers. We did have external help and always kept moving.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While mostly inspirational, she did show off some React code and revealed the entire talk including the live coding was done in the browser (thanks in part to Github’s Codespaces). Another treat was seeing the experiments that <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/speaker/kjell-reigstad/\">Kjell Reigstad</a> showcased in his talk about block styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile has-background\"><img width=\"250\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RtpKYzps_400x400.png?resize=250%2C250&ssl=1\" alt=\"Get Hired\" class=\"wp-image-85823 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size\" id=\"h-get-ready-for-remote-work\"><strong>Get started today!</strong> Build your career in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\"><strong>Build your network.

Some tidbits:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>On acquisitions in the WordPress space: </strong>Josepha overall favors them and sees acquisitions as part of a maturing market ,but it’s not all about the money: “Sometimes companies being acquired need guidance. Large companies can provide advice and funds for the smaller company to get further. Mergers and acquisitions shouldn’t be looked at something that decreases the diversity in the ecosystem.&#8221;</li><li><strong>On diversity:</strong> “WordPress can be used by anybody ,so it should be able to be built by anybody.” However, Jospeha acknowledges that ventures similar to the all-womens release team (which took almost 2 years to plan) might not be happening anytime soon so it doesn’t turn into a “gimmick” and can be used more effectively to attract more diverse audiences to contribute.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>On individual vs. corporate contributions: </strong>“Always important to me in terms of volume, we aim for 2/3 contribution from individuals and 1/3 that are corporately sponsored,” although right now the numbers are closer to 50/50.</li><li><strong>On increasing openness and transparency:</strong> For decision making in WordPress and the posts on make.wordpress.org (including her updates), Josepha said: “Even if people aren’t reading what goes into the decisions of WordPress, it’s just as important for people to go back and read that content than it is to read more traditional documentation.”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m biased, but I think overall the event was well done. Apart from Matt’s absence, it seemed to have a flavor of a WordCamp US throughout, complete with conversations happening on YouTube chat, Post Status Slack, and Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-get-involved-in-wordpress\">Get Involved in WordPress!</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column grey-message\">\n<ul><li>Have you thought about what you can do that might lead to speaking at a WordCamp or local meetup yourself? <strong>Abha Thankor</strong> has <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/how-to-get-involved-in-the-wordpress-community-after-attending-a-wordcamp/\">some suggestions</a> for you.</li><li>Jobs in WordPress involve a lot of 21st century skills in digital literacy and digital citizenship. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/episode-17-wordpressing-your-way-to-digital-literacy/\">In the latest <strong>WP Briefing</strong> podcast</a>, WordPress executive director <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> reflects on her WordCamp US keynote talk and discusses how participating in open source projects can help you learn these skills.</li><li>Get involved in <strong>Learn WordPress</strong>!

The solution should make the project even more appealing than before for those looking to break from third-party donation services and go the self-hosted route. The first version rolls out individual and team fundraising pages, leaderboards, campaign sponsor support, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, GiveWP offered a simple solution for setting up donations on a website. People could use it for everything from nonprofit organizations to fundraising smalltown baseball team jerseys. However, any efforts to raise money fell squarely on the site owner&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://givewp.com/addons/peer-to-peer/\">Peer-to-Peer add-on</a> changes that by allowing people who support a particular cause to be both an evangelist and a fundraiser for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Peer-to-Peer is a unique form of fundraising,&rdquo; said GiveWP co-founder Matt Cromwell. &ldquo;To date, GiveWP has been focused primarily on the single donation form. But Peer-to-Peer is about grouping individual fundraisers into teams, each with their own form and campaign goal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Campaign fundraising page.\n\n\n\n<p>The extension allows site owners to create an overarching campaign while breaking it down into smaller individual or team-led sub-goals. For example, a campaign can have a donation goal of $100,00, but teams can reach for smaller chunks of that, such as $10,000. Ultimately, all donations are pooled together into the campaign total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a type of fundraiser that nonprofits use to raise significant funds,&rdquo; said Cromwell. &ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t one-off simple fundraisers typically.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension adds a bit of gamification to fundraising campaigns. Individuals and teams are both added to separate leaderboards, showing their rank among their peers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Campaign leaderboards.\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals and teams can do more than just compete for the top rank on a campaign. They can customize their own fundraising page. It is this social element that helps bring a bit more humanity to a project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Examples of this type of fundraising are the Susan G Komen &lsquo;Race for the Cure&rsquo; or the Boston Marathon,&rdquo; said Cromwell. &ldquo;Individuals sign up to be team captains, they recruit team members. Members have goals that lead to the team goal. All teams together go toward the total campaign goal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are times when some fundraising efforts can feel a bit faceless, almost corporate-like entities asking for donations. When you start adding people from outside an organization to do some legwork, they may feel like part of something bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom team page.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, we consulted with our customers, we held a Town Hall to get their input and feedback,&rdquo; said Cromwell. &ldquo;Our customers have been asking to do this type of fundraising for years. We have a lot of input on this in our feedback system. The human element is part and parcel to the success of this popular form of fundraising.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A P2P solution was the <a href=\"https://feedback.givewp.com/feature-requests/p/peer-to-peer-fundraising\">top-voted feature request</a> through the GiveWP feedback system. As for the future of the add-on plugin, it is easy to see what the GiveWP&rsquo;s users are asking for through its own <a href=\"https://feedback.givewp.com/give-peer-to-peer\">feedback channel</a>. Currently, there is no shortage of ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are dedicating at least two developers per development cycle over the next few cycles to continue to improve and enhance P2P based on the ongoing feedback we get from our users,&rdquo; said Cromwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He did not give any specific details about other projects the GiveWP team is working on. However, he did note that they are excited about providing more solutions for nonprofits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to see our team providing more solutions outside of only the donation form side of things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nonprofits need stable, beautiful, and performant websites, and we think we can help on that front now too.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Oct 2021 00:42:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: September 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11327\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/the-month-in-wordpress-september-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16048:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There’s a lot of tolerance in open source software for shipping slightly imperfect work.

Cloudflare describes BGP as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\">the postal service of the Internet</a>.&rdquo; It is responsible for routing Facebook&rsquo;s traffic and making all of its domains accessible to visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To be more precise (and Geek Factor 5) the BGP routes serving Facebook\'s authoritative DNS were withdrawn, rendering all Facebook domains inaccessible.

BGP routing can be hijacked, but so far there is no evidence to suggest that it&rsquo;s anything other than an ill-timed configuration error. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook, and Facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money,&rdquo;&nbsp; former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen told <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/\">60 Minutes</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haugen copied tens of thousands of documents of internal research before leaving, one which stated: &ldquo;We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech and misinformation on Facebook and the family of apps are affecting societies around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haugen&rsquo;s interview with 60 Minutes had already made Facebook&rsquo;s lack of ethical compass a hot topic at media outlets before all of its web properties went down earlier today. This outage is one of the most severe in the company&rsquo;s 17-year history, due to the cascading effects of Facebook&rsquo;s infrastructure being tied into so many aspects of every day life. According to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/verizon-down-tmobile-ee-internet-b1932198.html\">The Independent</a>, reports of problems at internet and phone companies started rolling in, as Facebook and its related apps are often confused with the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whistleblower&rsquo;s evidence of the pernicious nature of Facebook&rsquo;s algorithms, combined with the widespread outage of the company&rsquo;s network of services, has sparked a renewed call for people and businesses to return to the open web. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Seems like a good time to remind every business owner that you do not own your audience on social media.

Businesses put themselves in a vulnerable place when they rely on a walled garden to deliver audience engagement, especially when that garden&rsquo;s algorithms promote divisive discourse and misinformation. Business owners should take recent events as a wakeup call and revoke all the permissions given to unaccountable platforms for short-term gains.

The claim was that, despite its current 40% market share, folks should start looking at alternatives for a better experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first developer interviewed for this piece was the CEO of Storyblok, Dominik Angerer. Storyblok is a headless CMS, a competitor to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second person interviewed for the article was Doeke Leeuwis, the founder and technical director for Story of AMS. The agency focuses on headless eCommerce. <em>What is one of the three platforms it uses?</em> If you guessed Storyblok, you would have gotten it right. Bonus points if you predicted it was listed first of the three in their marketing material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third developer interviewed was Mitchel van Bever, who also works for Story of AMS. The company has been featured multiple times on the Storyblok blog and is a featured case study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Are you starting to see a pattern yet?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read through the rest of the article, you will note that the post was sponsored by Storyblok. At least they were honest about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow I believe most readers would have skipped the article if that was posted before the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to find developers who dislike WordPress. But, you lose credibility when writing a piece that features interviewees who are either directly sponsoring or benefitting from the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The centerpiece for the entire story hinged on the <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020\">2020</a> Stack Overflow annual developer survey. There is a lot to glean from the data provided by over 65,000 workers in the field. However, the article merely focused on a single point: WordPress was voted the most dreaded language or technology at 67% in the last year. Everything else centered on what those with a vested interest in Storyblok had to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could talk about scalability, but with WordPress.com as a prime example of running the WordPress software at scale, do we really need to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could talk about flexibility, but when WordPress has more free third-party plugins (59,000+) than Storyblok has in total live websites (<a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Storyblok\">500+ according to BuiltWith</a>), is it really worth diving into?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a writer in the WordPress sphere, you may think I am entirely biased. That is at least partially true. However, I have worked with multiple systems. Laravel is one of my favorites, but its beautiful architecture does not always translate to quickly getting a job done in the same way as WordPress. I have helped friends and family launch projects on several non-WordPress services. It all depends on what the best tool for the job is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have even created my own custom CMS for my personal blog. I felt like WordPress was overkill for what I needed. It is OK to use another tool even when you typically prefer working with something else. My custom blogging system was built just for me, but it now runs on two websites. I had another developer friend crazy enough to try it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for WordPress is not absolute. It is not unconditional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I still love it. There are 1,000s of others who love working with it too, and these developers are more likely to tell you what the <em>actual</em> issues with the platform are. We can criticize it honestly because we are down in the trenches, working with the platform every day. We know it is not always the ideal programming experience. We know it has some legacy baggage. Despite its warts, we have built something that most others only dream of doing. We have created a vast community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you thought it was all about who had the shiniest code, you would be wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about business competitors willing to communicate and even help others in their space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a>, a program where WordPress-related companies contribute to free software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forum</a> volunteers lending a helping hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about the 100s of folks on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress</a> teams who contribute to various aspects of the project, everything from code reviews to translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about sharing a drink with a years-long friend you just met IRL for the first time at a <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a>, albeit mostly virtual for the last couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about the <a href=\"https://wppodcasts.com/\">podcasts</a> that people produce for the love of the platform and its surrounding projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about quitting your nine-to-five to launch a new business as a plugin developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about taking part in a movement that has allowed millions to publish on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, not every developer who participates in the annual Stack Overflow survey loves WordPress. Most of them may dread working with the platform, and that trend may very well continue. What we have is bigger. WordPress is its community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This smells like just another hit piece from a WordPress <em>competitor</em> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wixs-negative-advertising-campaign-falls-flat-with-wordpress-developers-and-professionals\">like we have seen before</a>. At least some of the Wix videos were funny (<em>come on, you know you laughed at at least one or two of them</em>), and folks <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wix-takes-a-jab-at-wordpress-with-bewildering-new-marketing-campaign\">got free headphones from the deal</a>. This Storyblok-sponsored post just leaves a sour taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like my grandma &mdash; probably everyone&rsquo;s grandma &mdash; used to say, &ldquo;You catch more flies with honey.&rdquo; This was an opportunity to sell potential users on Storyblok&rsquo;s features. Maybe bashing competitors brings traffic, but I doubt it brings any goodwill or long-lasting benefits.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 04 Oct 2021 22:32:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 17: WordPressing Your Way to Digital Literacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11316\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/episode-17-wordpressing-your-way-to-digital-literacy/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29419:\"<p>In episode 17 of the WordPress Briefing, Josepha Haden Chomphosy reflects on her WordCamp US keynote and digs into how participating in open source projects can help you learn 21st Century Skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I want to talk to you a little bit about the digital divide, where it is, maybe a bit of where it&#8217;s headed, and which parts of the WordPress open source project and CMS can help. This is a focused look, though, so I won&#8217;t touch on some of the hurdles that everyone is aware of when you get outside of in-person environments, things like parental modeling or supervision, education on the relevance of technology, etc. This is a follow-up to the conversation that I had at WordCamp US last week—and so doing a little bit of a deeper dive here. And we&#8217;re gonna start with what exactly is the digital divide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the digital divide is considered those who benefit from the digital age versus those who don&#8217;t; that feels like a really big concept. And the current discussion is primarily about access, or for years that has been about access anyway, especially physical access. So those who have computers versus those who do not have internet in their homes versus those who do not. But I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with that particular, really focused definition of the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the only problem we see is access, then the solution becomes to get cheap devices and internet to everyone, which certainly has led to more people being connected than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this proliferation of devices that are considered both smart and mobile (mobile in this context, meaning handheld or pocket-sized), the discussion over the last few years has been shifting. It’s been shifting into more of a discussion around the education around the relevance of internet access, discussions around the quality of access to the Internet, and also discussions around Wi-Fi and dial-up and the surprising cost of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from my perspective, there are a number of really dangerous assumptions that we make when we boil it all the way down to who has access and the quality of that kind of access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first dangerous assumption is that we run the risk of conflating being tech-savvy with being digitally literate, and they&#8217;re not really the same things. The second assumption that we run the risk of is assuming that access to cellular data equals access to the internet through any other means. And also assuming that cost is always the determining factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final fairly dangerous assumption that we&#8217;re making there is that we allow ourselves the ability to mark the digital divide is fixed in our minds. Once we get enough access to everyone, we&#8217;re just done. There is no more divide. But as a way of illustration, if you think about access, not in the context of technology, like high technology, digital technology, and in the context of like writing, you probably own a writing utensil, and you probably have access to paper of some sort, which is great. But just because you have like a pencil and a piece of paper doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you home right now &#8211; I guess most of you are listening at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you to your desk right now. And consider you prepared to write a best-selling novel, right? Because giving you physical tools no more makes you a novelist than handing me a computer when I was a teen made me digitally literate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s talk about what it takes to be digitally literate. I&#8217;ve lumped the following skills into three groups. It&#8217;s broadly defined as 21st-century skills, but the groups that I have them in is not a comprehensive list of those 21st-century skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first group that is a large component of digital literacy is critical thinking skills. So computational thinking and problem-solving. That particular one is not new, exactly. But the computational thinking part certainly is. Not all problems are solved with code, but the basis for thinking through things procedurally is increasingly important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one in that set is communication through multiple media, consuming communications or content through Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other format, but also creating the things that communicate—writing blogs, creating videos, both calls and standalone, and forums, things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third set in that group of critical thinking skills is around collaboration, which some people will say is more about communication. But I find that collaboration both online and in-person is a skill set all to its own. Communication only gets you so far when you&#8217;re learning to cook to collaborate with people that you don&#8217;t normally work with. And so, I have lumped that into critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big bucket for digital literacy is actually literally digital literacy. So I have three, three things in here as well. Evaluating information is obviously incredibly important in the environment that we&#8217;re in right now, for just information’s sake. But then things like understanding the differences between copyright versus copyleft licenses, understanding the difference between an .org ending URL and a .com ending URL, and evaluating the general veracity of sources that you&#8217;re finding on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that group is media use and creation, understanding the difference between folks who consume and folks who create the content we have, how to find information online, and the most sensible places to keep information online. And the third area of digital literacy that I find to be vitally important is the ethics of licenses both around use and access. So again, things like copyright vs. Copy, copyleft. And specifically for WordPress, that means understanding things like the Creative Commons licenses, GPL, MIT, but then also copyright is its own complicated question unto itself. But the other things that show up for us for WordPress that show up for us with technology are also things like open access versus proprietary information and sources. And things like plagiarism versus sampling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our third big bucket, which has become increasingly complex, but the third big bucket for digital literacy to my mind is actually considered something that I call life skills. So things like self-direction, knowing what you want to do next, and how to get it done. Time management is also in there, knowing how much time something will take and being able to make sure that you are getting things done over time, as opposed to trying to accomplish everything at the last second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of these life skills is cross-cultural and social communication. The internet is tricky, right? Because it&#8217;s simultaneously incredibly insular and increasingly global. Like you can if you wanted only ever read things that already confirm your existing biases. But the very nature of the internet, the very nature of the web, means that the world is much smaller. We have more ready access faster to everyone everywhere in the world than we used to have. This means, of course, that cultural awareness is an absolute must now more than ever. This is for what it&#8217;s worth the time of year when I give this talk. And that&#8217;s because of this last part of the life skills section, which is digital citizenship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital citizenship generally is the second week of October 2 or the third week of October. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite weeks because it is something that comes up all the time in our ecosystem. It comes up all the time and open source in general, but certainly for WordPress. So those are our three big buckets of digital literacy, a subset of 21st-century skills as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff, I know. And it&#8217;s also really hard to figure out how you can learn any of those skills, and from my experience, I really believe that WordPress as an open source project can help people learn those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, my mother told me that in order for me to become a better writer, I would have to read and in order to become a better communicator, it would probably help if I spent a little bit more time writing, and I have always felt that the same must be true for all the things that we learn, you find a positive example and study it to become better. Or, depending on what you&#8217;re learning and how you&#8217;re trying to learn it, you find a passive example of something that you want to be able to do better from an active standpoint and participate in that so that your active production of the other part is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few parts of the WordPress project and WordPress itself that can help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are first a few really specific teams; if you&#8217;re contributing to a team like Themes, or Plugins, or Core, the three areas of those digital literacy skills that you have an opportunity to learn there. For critical thinking, you&#8217;re going to run into problem-solving and computational thinking. You’re also going to run into distributed collaboration, which was really important as just a concept when I first wrote this talk. And now it is currently really important as a reality because we have a bunch of companies that are going to either remote work or partially distributed or fully distributed. And that&#8217;s the way that WordPress has worked for a pretty long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve always felt like it was important because it was important to WordPress, but it&#8217;s also becoming increasingly an important part of just how to exist in the world at the moment. For those three teams, the things that you can really tap into and practice for the life skill section are digital literacy, nope, digital citizenship, self-direction, and time management obviously comes up in any open source project because you are volunteering your time and it is up to you to kind of decide how much you can commit or not various other parts of time management and directing one&#8217;s own project. Now, but you also get the opportunity to test and practice your cross-cultural communication, social communication and learning what it means to collaborate across cultures in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the digital literacy side, you also get a little bit of that information evaluation and synthesis for what it&#8217;s worth. And then obviously get to learn more about the ethics of various types of licenses and how use and access relate to those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a team or two; these are not really teams or twos. These are things that you can do that are either solo activities or group activities. One is working or checking out the support forums, and the other is blogging. We’ll start with support forums.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re doing this as a group activity, there are a couple of extra things that that you can practice here. But suppose you&#8217;re doing it as a solo, just way to give back to the project sort of thing or way to learn some of these skills sort of thing. In that case, you can get almost all of these digital literacy skills woven into working in the support forums, depending on what&#8217;s happening in the moment and the questions people have brought up. But for critical thinking, obviously, you get some problem solving in there, not as much the computational thinking as the procedural thinking part. But you certainly also get to tap into communication with multiple types of media, collaboration in person and online, depending on whether you&#8217;re doing this as a solo effort or a group effort. And then, of course, research, which I didn&#8217;t really bring up in any of those groupings for digital literacy, is certainly a very important part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the digital literacy grouping of skills related to digital literacy, you get to work on evaluating information and, depending on how complicated an answer might be. You can also get that opportunity to practice synthesizing complex information and research, a digital literacy skill. And then, once people have responded to a topic you&#8217;ve answered, you also get to tap into that life skill section. You get to be you get the opportunity to practice digital citizenship related to synchronous or asynchronous conversation. You also get to see more about how cross-cultural communication and collaboration works and social communication across those various boundaries that naturally show up when we&#8217;re working across cultures that way. And as I mentioned previously, information synthesis, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one that I have mentioned can be like a solo effort or a group effort, depending on what you do. Blogging, for most people who use WordPress, is probably the most common application of how WordPress can help you do stuff. So I often see it as the most relevant and the most immediately accessible to anyone. But you know, you got to meet people where they are. So, I would strongly believe that this is our best way to help people learn these things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So blogging for the critical thinking sorts of things, you have an opportunity to practice communication across mediums. You will probably get an opportunity to practice your research skills, chances are, you&#8217;re going to get the opportunity to practice some problem solving, and honestly, like if you&#8217;re hosting your site, problem-solving is going to come up when using WordPress as soon as you add in plugins and themes, because you sometimes kind of have to figure out what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not, and what&#8217;s playing nicely with other things and what&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s possible that with blogging, you&#8217;re also going to have an opportunity to get to practice some distributed collaboration. But that&#8217;s probably going to depend on what you&#8217;re doing with your site as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Licenses and how they apply to the thing that you&#8217;re using feel a bit different when you are the one who&#8217;s creating. And so learning about how those things work and don&#8217;t work and how they can best suit what you&#8217;re trying to do. Blogging is absolutely an excellent opportunity to dig into that a bit and learn a bit more about that. As far as your life skills go,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that&#8217;s where you, again, get to practice some digital citizenship by figuring out who your audiences are and also when you have to communicate with them via the comments or any other way that you have built up a feedback mechanism there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-direction obviously will come into this, maybe time management if you are blogging on, I was gonna say on a paid basis, but that&#8217;s not really I don&#8217;t know, on a project basis, like some of us are students and have to write things based on deadlines. And so, you know, self-direction, potentially time management, always cross-cultural communication, social communication, research, all of these things show up in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I really believe in this concept of how blogging and bringing people into maintaining a website can teach you all of these skills. Because when I was younger, I was a bad communicator. And now, I am across the board known for my effective communication and my ability to work across cultures. And so the defining moment, which was like a four-year moment, and so not necessarily a moment, but the thing that really made all the difference was when my mom challenged me to write every single day. She had noted that I was not necessarily great at getting from one point to the next. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily great at building my arguments when I had to explain something to people. And she suggested that writing every day would help me tap into this big thing about communication and working with other people collaboration, all of that. And as an adult on the other side of it. Like, I thought she was super wrong when I was younger, because don&#8217;t we all think our parents are wrong when we&#8217;re younger. But as an adult on the other side of it, not only was that an opportunity for me to literally learn how to communicate better. But it also, when I look at it, gave me access to opportunities to practice all sorts of 21st-century skills and digital literacy skills in an environment that was relatively safe. And so, I am a big proponent of this particular one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another team that helps us tap into and practice a lot of our digital literacy skills is the Documentation team. I recommend that you let this be a supervised activity if you&#8217;re doing this with students because, you know, it&#8217;s a wiki. You can put weird things in there on accident or just inaccurate things. So for critical thinking, the primary skill that you&#8217;re going to be able to practice if you&#8217;re working on documentation is collaboration. You would think that it was also like information synthesis and information evaluation. But for a lot of the work that we&#8217;re doing, the documentation exists. And what we&#8217;re looking at is trying to figure out where it no longer matches what is currently in the CMS, or currently in the project or currently in the team, whatever it is that you&#8217;re working on at that moment. And so, it&#8217;s a strong collaborative effort in the WordPress project. You have to have done the general work to figure out what needs to be changed in the documentation. But a lot of times, you need to figure out who has access to make the changes, what has prevented us from making changes in the past, and things like that. And so I say, collaboration is the only one to learn and critical thinking, but it&#8217;s actually a really big one and can take a fair amount of effort in this particular context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>20:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the digital literacy aspect, of course, there is evaluating information. But this particular type of information evaluation is a little different for documentation. And this actually is true for the Documentation team, for the Training team, and also for the new Learn team. This question is true for all of them. There is a huge difference between presentation versus application of information. The way you present information for people who already know it and just need confirmation of something or are using it for reference material is really different from when people are looking at a piece of documentation that should be telling them how to accomplish something. And they try to apply it either to their own processes at the moment or apply it to teaching other people. And so evaluating information to make sure that what is presented can be applied, and all of the ways that that very complicated journey with managing information can kind of work or not, depending on how things are going in your section of the open source project at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>21:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third group of skills that you can really dig into in those teams, again, is digital citizenship, basically, everything is digital citizenship in WordPress because we&#8217;re just people online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this final grouping that we have this final team and group of skills. So the Community team is a substantial and far-ranging team; they have many things that fall into their area of expertise. And so this has traditionally kind of functioned as a linchpin around education and ensuring that that was all relevant for users and attendees of events. The Community team will remain pivotal to so many things that we do now. But now that we have really awakened the Learn team and re-enlivened that Training team, this will shift a little over time. But yes, so that grain of salt that depending on when you listen to this, if you listen to it in 2050, maybe it&#8217;s not accurate anymore. Hopefully, most of what I say is not accurate in 2050. But you know, still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Anyway! Critical thinking that&#8217;s where we were. So the critical thinking group of skills inside the Community team, you are going to have an opportunity to practice problem-solving. And frequently also procedural thinking, depending on what you&#8217;re working on in that team. Multimedia communication is absolutely true. And that&#8217;s true, whether you contribute to the team itself and make sure that the team is functioning and doing their basic tasks. Or if you are organizing an entire event, whether it&#8217;s online or offline or however that is being accomplished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multimedia communication for this particular team is constant for all of their work and something that everyone who works on there gets to practice all the time. For digital literacy, this comes up a lot if what you&#8217;re doing is working through any sort of like programming plans, making sure that what we have in place for events is really excellent. It&#8217;s a really excellent opportunity for practicing the evaluation of information, learning more about media use and creation, and then naturally, everything to do with licenses copyright copyleft, not only for everything that we produce but then also for everyone in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team helps so many plugins, authors and theme developers, and other groups who participate in the ecosystem understand the nuances of the GPL and why it matters so much to WordPress. And then in the life skill section, there&#8217;s the obvious life skill section, life skills that have come up for all of them—so digital citizenship, cross-cultural and social communication. But also you have the opportunity to tap into that self-direction and time management practice, which probably should also be considered in all of these teams. But, you know, things change as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the most likely digital literacy skills that you would end up practicing in the Community team, depending on how you are participating in the Community team at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said that we would talk a little bit about where this is all headed and what to do next. And like I just said, when I got lost in my own reverie, they&#8217;re like, hopefully, everything that I&#8217;ve shared here is out of date by 2050. Like, if we can come back to this particular podcast, or this presentation, or anything I&#8217;ve ever said, about digital literacy over my time with WordPress. And if we could come back to that in 2050, or, you know, I was going to say, 20 years from now, 2041 feels really close. But, you know, come back to it in the future, and say, that was all really excellent information to know at the moment. And we did do those things. And now, WordPress has proven that open source contribution and collaboration can teach all of the necessary 21st-century skills that anyone would need to survive in the world. And we did do it, that would be really cool. But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed. Not because I don&#8217;t think people believe in what I&#8217;m saying or care about what I&#8217;m saying. But because it&#8217;s very easy to kind of let these things go at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>27:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you at some point, were proficient in all of what is considered 21st-century skills, sometimes our skills don&#8217;t get used very much. And so we lose track of them. And we don&#8217;t know, or we don&#8217;t know how to teach them to other people and various ways to do that. So I hope that when we revisit this in the time capsule of the internet 20 years from now, we can say that was a great explanation. And we learned so much. And we made so many changes in such progress that now we need a new version of this. That&#8217;s really all we can do, always striving to leave the world in a better position than when we found it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>28:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, that brings us to our small list of big things. I don&#8217;t have a ton to share with you today. But what I do have to share with you is a really big deal. So we are about a week away from the Go/No-Go point of WordPress 5.9. That is the final release of the year. And as soon as we know what is a go or a no go from that meeting on October 12th,&nbsp; everyone is going just to hit the ground running. And so, if you are interested in contributing to that release, either by being a participant in the release squad or leading some part of the release squad. Absolutely. Drop by and let me know because I am interested to know who wants to learn more about doing that. And this is actually something that has gone by. I mentioned at the top that I spoke at WordCamp US.&nbsp; That is still true; I did do it. And so did a bunch of other really excellent presenters. If you missed WordCamp US on Friday, for whatever reason, because you know, life is complicated. Pretty soon, we will have the videos. We&#8217;ll have all the videos up with captions quickly and have those available for everyone to watch and learn more from as their schedule allows and as their attention allows. And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphos, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 04 Oct 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"Gutenberg Times: A Block Pattern Party in more ways than one – Weekend Edition 187\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=19137\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/a-block-pattern-party-in-more-ways-than-one-weekend-edition-187/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17739:\"<p>Howdy! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you get to watch the fantastic presentations about the block-editor at WordCamp US?

The duo has made continual updates to the plugin since. In the past couple of months, they have added deep integration with Easy Digital Downloads. They are also planning to build around more eCommerce-related plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge mentioned that using the Logtivity service allows site owners to track and log activity at scale. While small sites could get by with an on-site solution, it can be harder to do while growing. &ldquo;This offers a strong alternative to using a plugin because you don&rsquo;t need to store huge amounts of data on your own server,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service provides graphs so that end-users can visualize their data, but they can also dive directly into the logs and look at specific actions. Users can also set up unlimited alert notifications through email or Slack and download reports as CSV files.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Site dashboard showing different chart types.\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/logtivity/\">Logitivity WordPress plugin</a> is free to download and install, but it merely serves as a bridge to the commercial service. The <a href=\"https://logtivity.io/pricing/\">pricing page</a> has three tiers that start at $9.50/month and run to $49.50. The rates primarily differ on the number of logs generated, user access, and length of data retention. However, each tier can be used on an unlimited number of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been running the service on WP Tavern for a couple of weeks. There are not many things I would want to track specific to this site other than posts published and commenting numbers. The short-term data has not told me much that I did not know already. However, I could see how these logs could come in handy over months or years. If we were running an eCommerce website, the information could be invaluable.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Viewing a specific set of logs based on an action.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can create reports of specific logs and display them as either bar or line charts. These can be generated based on an action, such as &ldquo;Post Published&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comment Created.&rdquo; Users can also add a specific context, such as a post ID. For example, a user could display a chart for each product file download through the plugin&rsquo;s deep integration with Easy Digital Downloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the type of thing that the team has in mind at the moment. The primary use case since launch has been logging eCommerce activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;People who run eCommerce sites need to track registrations, subscription changes, file downloads, license key activations, login activity, and more,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;eCommerce site owners need this for customer support and also to deal with refund requests and chargebacks.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, each of the service&rsquo;s features is handled via the Logtivity site. The team has plans to bring them into the WordPress admin interface. However, it could be late 2021 or early 2022 before the integration happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to bring Logtivity data directly into WordPress,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;And because there&rsquo;s no need to worry about Logtivity slowing down your site, we have some interesting ideas for how and where user activity can be displayed in the WordPress admin area.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How It Started and Where It Is Going</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Burge serves as the marketing brains behind the project. His primary WordPress-related business is <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/\">PublishPress</a>, but his customers had asked for a project like Logitivity for several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ralph Morris started Logtivity for a customer at the web dev agency he works at,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;The customer&rsquo;s site has around 100,000 users and gets a great deal of activity every day, from new registrations and subscriptions to resources being downloaded and cancellations. They were using a WordPress plugin to track customer activity, but as the number of logs grew, this process took longer and longer and became more clunky to perform. The final straw was when they were unable to perform the CSV exports, as it would keep timing out. Ralph scratched the itch and built a little MVP. After a few weeks, he showed it to his colleagues and got permission from his boss to offer it to the client to be the first user, and a little while later, the first paying customer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the two connected thanks to Iain Poulson, who recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/alex-denning-and-iain-poulson-launch-flipwp-an-acquisitions-marketplace-for-wordpress-companies\">co-launched the acquisitions marketplace FlipWP.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ralph lives really close to where I grew up in Hampshire, England,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;We got our heads together and decided on a partnership: Ralph as the developer and myself as the marketer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of integrating more directly with the WordPress admin, the Logtivity team has a roadmap that will keep them busy for a while. Topping that list are more integrations with third-party plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our primary use-case is eCommerce sites, so WooCommerce is central to our plans,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;But we also plan deeper integrations with more plugins that WordPress eCommerce sites use, including LearnDash, MemberPress, Paid Memberships Pro, and more.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several players in the space are moving toward broad integrations across the ecosystem. Chris Lema talked about it being a vital strategy for business growth with StellarWP&rsquo;s recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/stellarwp-acquires-learning-management-system-learndash\">acquisition of LearnDash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge also noted that his team plans to continue improving the service&rsquo;s alert system. &ldquo;In future versions of Logtivity, you&rsquo;ll be able to send more flexible alerts to more channels. We also plan to provide SMS alerts for your most important notifications.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 21:49:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: Version 4.2.1 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2130\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/10/01/version-4-2-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:559:\"<p>Version 4.2.1 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>This update contains a fix for a bug in version 4.2 that could cause AMP validation errors on some sites, depending on the template they were using.</p>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

When defining a block, developers can now use the lock attribute to designate whether a block can be moved or removed. The PR introduces parts of the locking support mechanisms proposed by Matias Ventura in a separate <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29864\">issue</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura explained that while the editor already has template locking support to prevent inserting or moving blocks (i.e. for custom post type templates), it doesn&rsquo;t yet offer much granular control or a UI for the different locking states. He identified block themes as an important use case for establishing a new block-level API for representing&nbsp;<code>lock</code>&nbsp;status. Block themes may necessitate the ability to lock down key elements, such as preventing the removal of the post-content for a single post template. If you have ever played around with the template editor then you have likely discovered how easy it is to remove important elements by accident. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29864\">Block locking UI mockup</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Another use case that we&rsquo;re building for is having a Checkout Block with different blocks that act as fundamental steps,&rdquo; WooCommerce and Gutenberg engineer Seghir Nadir said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want people to delete or move those steps since they&rsquo;re fundamental and their order is also important, but we want to allow people to select them, access settings, and insert blocks in between them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this week&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/30/editor-chat-summary-29th-september-2021/\">core editor chat</a>, Paal Joachim Romdahl highlighted the need for a locking mechanism for Reusable blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At the moment it is too easy to make an accidental change to a Reusable block,&rdquo; Romdahl said. &ldquo;I worry that only having the hover overlay and the initial click [to] select the parent Reusable block is just not good enough, that we soon should get a lock mechanism in place. There is a lot of feedback from users who have accidentally deleted the inner contents of the blocks and wondered what happened.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romdahl has created several <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32461\">issues</a> about to the possibility of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31163\">adding a locking mechanism to the inline toolbar for reusable blocks</a>, where users would need to unlock to edit the contents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the foundational infrastructure is in place for managing lock control at the block-type level, contributors can begin building a UI to control it, as outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29864\">Locking and TemplateLocking</a> issue. Ventura said future iterations should include a UI that indicates which blocks are user-editable and also display block status in the list view and block inspector.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 05:00:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 11.6 Improves the Global Styles UI, Adds Child Theme Support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123580\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:203:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-6-improves-the-global-styles-ui-adds-child-theme-support?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-11-6-improves-the-global-styles-ui-adds-child-theme-support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6450:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 11.6 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v11.6.0\">landed yesterday</a>. Contributors added dozens of enhancements and bug fixes. Admittedly, there was not a whole lot that excited me as a user about this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31623\">Typography options</a> for the Post Title block. <em>Nice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31607\">Cropping</a> for the Site Logo. <em>A necessary addition.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toolbar button for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34606\">converting old Gallery blocks</a> to the new &mdash; still experimental &mdash; format. <em>Sweet.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the release felt like a slew of routine enhancements that have been in the pipeline for those of us closely following the plugin&rsquo;s development. Almost boring. And that is not a bad thing at all. Less excitement and smaller doses of iterative improvements can be healthy for the project and its developers. We do not always need to feel like we are chasing the next big thing. This is a well-rounded release that polishes many areas, from navigation to widgets to general block enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two features that I am happy to see movement on. That is the site editor&rsquo;s Global Styles system and child theme support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Styles Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Default site editor look with Global Styles panel open.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Global Styles is the system that will truly connect end-users to theme developers and vice versa for the first time in WordPress history. We have made some attempts at this, such as the customizer. However, this feature will handle it on top of the standardized block system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, themes will <em>talk</em> to WordPress through their <code>theme.json</code> files, and users will speak the same language through the Global Styles panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, imagine a theme author sets up the default text color as black and the background as white. This will appear on the front end of the site but also be reflected in the site editor. The Global Styles interface allows users to change those two colors to something they prefer.  They can also see of a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34991\">preview of their color and typography styles</a> in the box at the top of the panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Updating colors, preview shown in editor and at top of panel.\n\n\n\n<p>And, it does not stop at a couple of simple colors. Users can modify all sorts of design aspects like typography and spacing at the root and block levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 11.6 adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34885\">navigation component</a> to the Global Styles sidebar. Overall, it feels much smoother working through the top and sub-levels while editing my theme&rsquo;s styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Updating the global padding for the Code block.\n\n\n\n<p>This is sort of a small but vital step toward <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34574\">overhauling the overall Global Styles interface</a>. There is still much work to be done, but I am eager to see where the Gutenberg contributors take this component in the coming weeks and months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did run into one snag. Clicking on the Typography tab at the root level produces an error. However, it works at the block level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors also updated the old &ldquo;Aa&rdquo; icon representing the Global Styles panel with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34871\">half-dark-half-light circle button</a>. My immediate reaction was that it was for switching between light and dark modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20873#issuecomment-923241684\">sentiment shared</a> by a user (from a now-deleted account) in the GitHub ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Global Styles is not a new system disconnected from styles and themes, indeed is an improvement to the current themes system. If we were to consider the strength of WordPress&rsquo; past and present, we would perceive that on the dashboard, indeed a brush icon has been developed for years in people&rsquo;s memory as an association with appearance, themes, styles, personalization. Therefore, the icon that would be most comprehensible in people&rsquo;s memory regarding the new Customizer remains a brush. I say new and better Customizer, because this is how common people manifest what they understand about Global Styles. Departing from a pencil brush to yin-yang, moon, or water drop, I have not tested yet with public, but from past experience I assure you people are going to find this new icon unrelated and confusing.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Child Theme Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As one of the pioneers of child theming in WordPress, using them long before they were officially supported, this is something near and dear to my heart. I created my first theme shop on this foundation. I have loads of ideas about how the block paradigm can reshape the theme space, and child themes are at the center of many of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, all of the components of Full Site Editing have not entirely supported child themes until now. There are still a few pieces left to fit into the puzzle, but the system should work, mostly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Templates, template parts, and <code>theme.json</code> files from a child theme should now completely <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34354\">overrule those from the parent</a>. These changes work on both the front end and in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some open questions are being worked through in a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/25612\">related GitHub ticket</a>. The most crucial development is still to come, which will handle merging values between the parent and child <code>theme.json</code> files. For example, it makes sense that child themes should be able to overwrite colors and typography while skipping definitions for layout-related values, falling back to the parent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that is in place, designers will have an easy-yet-powerful way to realize the original vision behind <a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\">CSS Zen Garden</a>, a project that at least partially inspired child theming&rsquo;s adoption by WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 01:45:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Akismet: Version 4.2 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2126\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/09/30/version-4-2-of-the-akismet-wordpress-plugin-is-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:735:\"<p>Version 4.2 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.

There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To coincide with International Translation Day and the final day of the <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">2021 WordPress Translation celebration</a>, we feature the story of a WordPresser who has made a major impact in the polyglots team. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beyond software, meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/yordan-min-300x300@2x.jpg?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11299\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For Yordan Soares from South America, finding WordPress also meant discovering friends, community, and opportunities. He had not expected to find a whole global movement behind the web development software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan, who is from Venezuela, South America, said: “The first time I used WordPress, I had no idea what was going on behind the software or beyond it. I knew there was someone making it all work, but I couldn’t even remotely imagine all the people who were making WordPress not just a tool for developing websites, but a whole movement that comes together to share, build, and help make the world better.”<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turning your hobby into your job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Yordan earned his income from computer technical support and installing networks for small and medium-sized businesses. Back in 2005, web development and code-writing was just a hobby. When he discovered the concept of CSS and how it could make everything dynamic. This opened up a whole new career pathway for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, an introduction to WordPress through a friend opened up a future he had not imagined. He stopped using any other content management system (CMS) and wanted to explore how much he could do with the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years later in 2013, he was able to take his WordPress journey further by starting a small advertising agency with some of his friends. During this time, they crafted commercials for local radio and TV stations. Through WordPress, they found it easy to build more than 15 websites for businesses in a market that previously had not valued the importance of having an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “We were working for almost four years until at the end of 2017 the economic crisis in Venezuela became too acute, and we decided to close the agency when we stopped making profits. Taking stock of that period, I think we changed the way merchants saw the Internet business in the city.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Working full time as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One year on in 2018, Yordan began to freelance full-time as a web developer. His first clients were primarily agencies and friends who had emigrated to other countries. Later, he expanded into freelance marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, getting started as a freelancer was quite a challenging task in Venezuela. The first hindrance was getting a fair level of recompense. Additionally, the deteriorating conditions in the country with constant blackouts and internet connection failures complicated matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Yordan was living in Guarenas, where the situation was relatively better. He managed to get a reasonably uninterrupted electricity supply with adequate internet speed, which was just good enough to complete his projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Surely if I hadn’t met the community, I would have continued to work on my own, like a lone wolf, doing the ordinary work of solving problems for occasional customers and paying my bills,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in Guarenas, Yordan began to experience stability in his career and made new friends and contacts. He began looking for co-working spaces or technology communities nearby, and that’s when he met the WordPress community in Caracas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He quickly signed up for the first face-to-face event. As soon as the event concluded, he went to talk to the co-organizer and offered his help. He was inspired to help with designing promotional pieces, managing social networks, and organizing events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through such events, he met and connected with several people living in nearby cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><img width=\"120\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1-120x300.png?resize=120%2C300&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11300 size-medium\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"> A few months later, with other WordPress users in the area, the idea emerged to start a new Guarenas-Guatire meetup group. The idea became a reality by December 2019, when they applied to the WordPress community team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final approvals came in, the team started scheduling the activities. The <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-meetup-guarenas-guatire/\">WordPress Guarenas-Guatire Meetup</a> was officially recognized!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first quarter of 2020, just before the pandemic, Yordan and colleagues organized five face-to-face events. With the worldwide lockdown, in-person community engagements came to a halt. However, the Guarenas-Guatire community was eager to continue meeting.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep the community active and motivated, and with the support of sponsors, they started organizing online events under a format called “WordPress a la medianoche” (WordPress at midnight).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of these events was inspired by Alexis Arnal, who suggested meeting at midnight to make the most of the internet speed that would usually improve somewhat after that time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Yordan and the team have organized 16 WordPress a la medianoche events with an attendance of up to 50 people per online gathering. An impressive audience which enabled a comparatively small meetup to keep communications flowing at a difficult and unprecedented time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One positive of such events, is an opportunity to invite people from other countries and run sessions in partnership with others. An example was a special translation event with Javier Esteban, a member of the translation team from Spain. The meetup also invited contributors from Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia who were happy to participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strengthened by the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=632%2C241&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11307\" />Yordan (pictured bottom left) speaking at the WordPress Translation Day 2020 events\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan believes that he would have continued to work on his own had he not met the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Fortunately, this was not the case and I have been able to live a lot of transforming experiences that have shown me the meaning of the words &#8216;community&#8217; and &#8216;volunteerism&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan felt empowered by the community and it led him to volunteer for many other roles and activities, including Locale Manager for <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/es-ve/\">Spanish Venezuela</a>, a moderator for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>, and as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/\">support</a> contributor in the forums helping people with technical issues. He has also developed free plugins for the official WordPress directory and <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/speakers/yordan-soares/\">spoken at community events</a> including <a href=\"https://spain.wordcamp.org/2020/session/actualizaciones-automaticas-para-tus-plugins-y-temas-personalizados/\">WordCamp Spain 2020</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this has a boomerang effect, Yordan explains. These experiences helped him grow personally and professionally, as it’s always rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also likes being able to directly help people when they need it and feels it is a two-way learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At first, when I told my family and friends about the community and the work I was doing, they would ask me &#8216;what do you get in return?&#8217; Perhaps they expected me to tell them a specific amount of money, but the answer is more complex,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem, the tool you use to work and put food on the table.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his journey, Yordan has met many wonderful people with common interests and values, and the best part is that many of these people are now his friends, business partners, or customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, he has learned new skills and gained experience, which have given him a significant confidence boost in facing difficult situations that may come in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=632%2C332&ssl=1\" alt=\"Polyglots special appreciation.

His new site, aptly named <a href=\"https://wpblockpatterns.com/\">WP Block Patterns</a>, allows users to preview any WordPress.org-hosted block themes and patterns together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project does not allow visitors to download anything or ask them to sign up. It is a basic demo system, one that WordPress.org should consider at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors can choose any block pattern. Then, they can select any theme to see what they look like together. It is a quick way to test patterns and themes without actually adding them to your WordPress installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a user can view the <a href=\"https://wpblockpatterns.com/team-social-cards/?theme=tove\">Team Social Cards</a> pattern &mdash; one that I had a hand in creating &mdash; along with Anders Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s Tove theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Or, the <a href=\"https://wpblockpatterns.com/image-and-quote-on-a-background/?theme=naledi\">Image and a Quote on a Background</a> pattern with Anariel Design&rsquo;s Naledi theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>From Gutenberg Hub&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-hub-launches-landing-page-templates-directory\">landing page templates</a> to EditorsKit&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/creator-of-editorskit-launches-community-block-sharing-site\">ShareABlock collection</a>, the block system has allowed developers to experiment with unique sites for end-users. Because everything is built upon a standard, I am guessing we will see even more of these creative projects in the future. WP Block Patterns is another step in that journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not always the plan for the WP Block Patterns site. Starr set out to blog about patterns after their feature release in WordPress 5.5. After only publishing a single post, the project fell to the wayside. Fortunately, inspiration struck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have a site that I use as my reference point when providing support for my themes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This site has a blend of varying content and code that allows me to quickly switch/preview any of my themes, without the need to actually change the active theme in the admin, or maintain a different site for every theme.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the process of making improvements to his theme-switching functionality, the domain came up for renewal. He had planned to let it expire but decided to see if he could come up with something to do with the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I got the inspiration to use the theme switcher in conjunction with content from block patterns,&rdquo; said Starr. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been working on my script at the same time as I coincidently received the domain expiration message, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have had this idea.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, he is manually installing the themes on the site but may have to automate it in the future as more block themes are released. However, he is pulling patterns and categories directly from the WordPress.org API, which is periodically updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site only showcases 100% block themes. Technically, it should work with any that supports editor styles. Starr said it had never crossed his mind to showcase non-block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have been keeping my eye on the releases of FSE themes, checking out every block theme that I come across, and it just sort of seems that block themes are the future, and classic themes feel like a step backwards now after investing so much time working with block themes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The site would work just fine with classic themes, but there are so many available I&rsquo;m not sure how to make it manageable or select which themes to feature (and which ones to leave out). I guess that&rsquo;s also something I&rsquo;ll have to think about as the number of block themes increases.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, Starr has released two block themes, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hansen/\">Hansen</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/pria/\">Pria</a>, through his UXL Themes brand. Users can preview both via the site. However, he is already working on his next project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As a proof of concept, I am working on a classic theme that will have the functionality to also be a block-based theme when FSE is available in core,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The idea is that the user will not notice any front-end differences when the theme &lsquo;switches&rsquo; from classic to block-based, but the user will gain the new FSE admin tools, with the user&rsquo;s classic customizer modifications switched over intact to the new Site Editor. I have found that there are compromises that need to be made when getting classic and FSE to work together seamlessly in a single theme, so I am not sure whether this will be released generally.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also teased a project related to FSE that is neither a theme nor a plugin. However, he was not ready to share any details just yet.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:44:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2021 Kicks Off Online in 48 Hours\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123520\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:155:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2021-kicks-off-online-in-48-hours?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-us-2021-kicks-off-online-in-48-hours\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2517:\"<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US</a>, WordPress&rsquo; largest flagship event in the Western Hemisphere, is set to   kick off on Friday, October 1, at 11:45 AM EDT. The single-day event will include sessions, workshops, networking events, virtual sponsor booths, and <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/musicians/\">musical interludes</a>. Get ready to be inspired by new ideas and learn about the latest and greatest capabilities in the exciting frontier of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for the event, attendees can view the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/schedule/\">schedule</a>, star sessions they want to catch, and email, link, or print them. The event features two simultaneous tracks, one focused more on development (Columbia) and another for less-technical topics (Yukon). </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many previous years, WordCamp US will not include Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s annual State of the Word address. This year the event will be capped off with a presentation from WordPress&rsquo; executive director, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/session/a-chat-with-josepha/\">Grow Your Story</a>,&rdquo; where she will discuss&nbsp;&ldquo;trends seeded in 2020&rdquo; and future growth opportunities for the community. Haden Chomphosy said there will be a State of the Word later in the year, possibly &ldquo;at a hybrid in-person/live broadcast format (in December),&rdquo; but the details are still being worked out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US 2021 has its own custom, outdoorsy wapuu designed by Alyssa Hogan. The mascot is holding a map and sporting a WordPress cap, backpack, and camping gear to go along with the event&rsquo;s National Parks website theme designed by Mel Choyce-Dwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/meet-wcus-2021-wapuu/\">WordCamp US</a>\n\n\n\n<p>The traditional <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/job-board/\">Job Board</a> has made a return this year but is limited to the event&rsquo;s upper level sponsors. In future years, if the virtual aspect of the event is preserved alongside the in-person activities, it would be good to see this board expanded to include all sponsors and even some community-submitted listings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 2,000 people have already signed up to attend WordCamp US online. <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/tickets/\">Registration is free</a> and still open if you haven&rsquo;t yet gotten your ticket.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 20:56:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:150:\"HeroPress: When the world was down, the WordPress community was up – Cuando el mundo necesitaba un descanso, la comunidad de WordPress estaba activa\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4140\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:182:\"https://heropress.com/essays/when-the-world-was-down-the-wordpress-community-was-up/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=when-the-world-was-down-the-wordpress-community-was-up\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6293:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092821-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Thank you to everyone who contributes to WordPress.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#espanol\">Este ensayo también está disponible en español.</a></p>\n<p>This is not meant to be another gloomy story about the year 2020 but a big thank you to the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>All started four days into 2020 when my biggest client called me to ask to take his website down as he was filing for bankruptcy. I should’ve known it was a bad omen of what was to come.</p>\n<p>As the year continued and the world succumbed into the unknown, many businesses closed their doors, among them, most of my clients, my own business and my mental health.</p>\n<p>Of course, when left without income, I applied to as many jobs as I followed people on Twitter who were helping others get WordPress related jobs, but I couldn’t even get an interview.</p>\n<h3>Then Came WordCamp</h3>\n<p>By the time we were busy helping plan for the first WordPress Europe Online, I was asked to become a team rep for design and later joined the 5.5 release team, I even designed the 5.5 About page and showed the world that I am not a visual designer!</p>\n<p>As time passed, I started looking forward to those weekly meetings with the design team, which brought many lessons and stressful evenings accompanied by cheers, smiles, support comments and many virtual hugs. I don’t know if everyone knew I needed them, but they brought me back to life, day by day… week by week, I so much needed those meetings.</p>\n<p>Months passed and I got involved with other teams and got to virtually meet many more contributors and everyone always had something positive to give.</p>\n<p>Last summer, at WCEU at a panel I was asked what my favorite part was from contributing to WordPress and my answer without hesitation will always be “the community”.</p>\n<h3>Personal Triumph</h3>\n<p>I am proud of everything I have done within WordPress but perhaps my most loved project, still in progress, is the recategorization of the end-user documentation. It started as a personal project, now is my gift to the community.</p>\n<p>As I am about to end my tenure as design team rep, I want to reflect into the good things I got from the community: many late nights with the release teams (the release parties are the best), many new friends &#8211; that I am so looking forward to one day meet in person and to hug those that I already know. A better idea of what I want to do in my professional life. An intense learning year about WordPress, leadership, contribution, open source and friendship.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has in one way, or another been there for me. Thank you to everyone who has been there to mentor and to support other contributors. Thank you to everyone who contributes to WordPress. And lastly, thank you to my two friends and guardian angels, Tammie <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karmatosed\">@karmatosed</a> and Monique <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boemedia/\">@boemedia</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"espanol\">Cuando el mundo necesitaba un descanso, la comunidad de WordPress estaba activa</h1>\n<p>Esta no pretende ser otra historia sombría sobre el año 2020, sino un gran agradecimiento a la comunidad de WordPress.</p>\n<p>Todo comenzó cuatro días después de 2020 cuando mi mayor cliente me llamó para pedirme que cerrara su sitio web porque se iba a declarar en quiebra. Debería haber sabido que era un mal presagio de lo que estaba por venir.</p>\n<p>A medida que avanzaba el año y el mundo sucumbía a lo desconocido, muchos negocios cerraron sus puertas, entre ellos, la mayoría de mis clientes, mi propio negocio y mi salud mental.</p>\n<p>Por supuesto, cuando me quedé sin ingresos, solicité tantos trabajos como seguí a personas en Twitter que estaban ayudando a otros a conseguir trabajo relacionado con WordPress, pero ni siquiera pude conseguir una entrevista.</p>\n<h3>Tiempo de la WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Mas adelante, mientras planeábamos la primera WordPress Europe Online, me invitaron a ser representante del equipo de diseño y luego me uní al equipo de lanzamiento de 5.5, incluso diseñé la página Acerca de 5.5 y le mostré al mundo que no soy una diseñadora visual!</p>\n<p>Con el paso del tiempo, comencé a esperar con ansias esas reuniones semanales con el equipo de diseño, que trajeron muchas lecciones y veladas estresantes acompañadas de sonrisas, comentarios de apoyo y muchos abrazos virtuales. No sé si todos sabían que los necesitaba, pero me devolvieron la vida, día a día &#8230; semana a semana, necesitaba tanto esas reuniones.</p>\n<p>Pasaron los meses y me involucré con otros equipos y pude conocer virtualmente a muchos más colaboradores que siempre tenían algo positivo que ofrecer.</p>\n<p>El verano pasado, durante un panel en WCEU, me preguntaron cuál es mi parte favorita de contribuir a WordPress y mi respuesta sin dudarlo siempre ha sido “la comunidad”.</p>\n<h3>Un triunfo personal</h3>\n<p>Estoy orgullosa de mis contribuciones para WordPress, pero quizás mi proyecto más querido, que continúo trabajando en el, es la re-categorización de la documentación del usuario. Este comenzó como un proyecto personal, hoy en día, es mi regalo a la comunidad.</p>\n<p>Ahora que estoy finalizando mi termino como representante del equipo global de diseño, quiero reflexionar sobre las cosas buenas que obtuve de la comunidad: muchas noches con los equipos de lanzamiento (las fiestas de lanzamiento son las mejores), muchos amigos nuevos, que espero algún día conocer en persona y abrazar a los que ya conozco. Una mejor idea de lo que quiero hacer en mi vida profesional. Un año de intenso aprendizaje sobre WordPress, liderazgo, contribución, código abierto y amistad.</p>\n<p>Gracias a todos los que de una forma u otra me han apoyado. Gracias a todos los que han orientado y apoyado a otros colaboradores. Gracias a todos los que contribuyen a WordPress. Y por último, gracias a mis dos amigas y ángeles de la guarda, Tammie <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karmatosed\">@karmatosed</a> y Monique <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boemedia/\">@boemedia</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:00:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Estela Rueda\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 18:42:46 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 18:30:10 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211020175551\";}', 'no');
